1. In which the author pulls a cute little rhetorical trick in which you're either pro feminism, or an abusive cunt sending death threats to Anita Sarkeesian.  The notion that there's nothing wrong with representation of women in video games, that the feminist attacks on games are disingenuous cherry picking nonsense somehow fails to find a way into the author's headspace.

1. This isn't even a debate. Brock turner is a garbage human being, and you're using the weakest debating strategy on earth. When women do it, it's okay!" is a dumbcunt argument. Your argument should not be equating us; Your argument should be "while I realize women struggle with lots of social hardships like stigmas and the threat of being overpowered by a man, men, who are mostly good people, go through hardships as well. Hardships that many women don't recognize or even realize exist, and here they are (1), (2), (3). So, my goal is not to make women feel like they are the responsibility of shitty women, because I am not responsible for the behavior of shitty men, but rather for us to come together on our issues and figure out the way forward that benefits everyone."  THAT is an argument, not "ya but brock turner used a pinecone lol" fuck out of here with that shit, dumbass.

8. 					U had referred to me as a moron yet you also decided to not read my entire argument without putting forth a counter argument. And to again use your own words saying that "men are the primary victims of violent crime, but men are the overwhelming perpetrators of crime" is a bullshit argument. The fact that men commit more crime does not make my argument disingenuous. According to the way you have presented your argument, you are putting forth the idea that since men commit a lot of the crimes, when men are the victims of crime it does not matter. Yes not all women rape, the people of this sub understand that (tho some people on r/feminism believe that all men rape) however the conversation I had with this feminist was about media portrayal and perceptions of male vs female victims of crimes. Please do not claim that I am making this sub a shit show if you attempt to argue without 1) knowing what your talking about 2) not even attempting to read my argument. A big thing in this sub is listening to both sides of something, yet ur ignorant ass couldn't be bothered to listening to what I had to say.

10. 			We women don't constantly fear a man kidnapping us and ass-raping us until we die, and there is no "good reason" to do so. That sounds the same as when feminists claim that every time a woman engages in sex she's also incredibly afraid that if she said no the man would rape her. It's a scare tactic used to shame and silence men and it has no basis in reality.   By your logic, every man is deeply afraid every night he goes to bed that his wife or girlfriend will cut off his penis while he's sleeping. And then, you know, have the entire country laugh at him as they barbecue wieners and cheer his female partner.   It is frequently reinforced by the culture that females never rape, sexually assault or harass men, but that's largely a reflection of our inability to see and tendency to dismiss it when it happens. A man grabs a woman's crotch? He's practically a rapist, even if she liked it, he was supposed to ask first. Woman grabs a man's crotch? She's just a strong sexually empowered female who goes after what she wants, or at least it was just for fun and he didn't mind anyway, he probably liked it.   By the way, here's a study which states "the CDC’s nationally representative data revealed that over one year, men and women were equally likely to experience nonconsensual sex, and most male victims reported female perpetrators."

I dislike the police, but he didn’t escalate; she hit him with her hands, he hit her with his. Because he is larger it hurt her more, that’s what happens. Don’t hit police!

1. And this is one more reason why I feel like I was born in the wrong time to reach critical acclaim. >.>  I hope, if I ever end up publishing, instead of making a modest amount of money to bankroll my next book (like most first time authors do), I hope it's a fucking disaster of SJW hate. I make enough money with my day job that I can self publish for just the laughs. However I'm 99.9% sure I won't meet either goal and just remain obscure with no sales.  That being said: One of my protagonists begins the story as a stronk womanyn who don't need no man. She ends up getting romantically entangled with a man, and while she does not initiate the start of the relationship, she's the one to initiate the first time they *do it.*  And it starts out great. Lots of kissing, little whispered sweet nothings, and then the guy goes to touch her and *wham* she knocks his fucking lights out.  Their relationship throughout the rest of the book involves a lot of her trying to get it on, then getting arbitrarily uncomfortable and punching him or pushing him away or slapping him.

1. Melbourne has massive issues with Somali and Sudanese*** gangs.   The ABC did an article on it showing the stats Sudanese* immigrants are around 27x more likely to engage in criminal activity) but then went on to say it's racist to do anything about it.  Melbourne dropped something like 5 points from being the most livable city in the world in last years rankings. Mainly because it's a left-wing shithole.  This is the fucking state of Australian politics...   The political Zeitgeist Australia is about 8 years behind the US. We had a great chance with Abbot (I hated him when he was in but I realise now he was a champ) and hopefully we get someone like David Leyonhjelm in in the future.  Edit: Sudanese/Somali

If he’s on the floor unconscious and you continue to hit him you’re risking giving the person brain damage or even killing them, making you a giant piece of shit. I mean, the person isn’t going to feel any of the damage you’re dealing since he’s unconscious so there really is no point unless you’re a cunt.

3. 		>We don't have enough workers? (Bull shit)  They don't have enough ***cheap*** workers.   Why in the world would a multi-national want to pay a wage that a Canadian expects when they could pay significantly less by over-saturating the labor pool, and straining social programs?   All of the Canadian manufacturing, call center & etc. jobs shipped overseas clearly demonstrates they don't give a shit about Canada or Canadians, just their bottom line.  >and it's not a problem they are homophobic   Not to the ultra-progs who believe in intersectionality. Because they're pro-tranny!   Like in Iran, where you're not allowed to be one of those disgusting faggots. Instead of allowing you to continue to live in sin as a degenerate, the state will just pay to have you sexually reassigned.  Or in Pakistan, where the Hijra are employed by the state as tax collectors. Because the people find them so embarrassing and abhorrent they would rather pay the taxes they've been evading than have trannies causing a ruckus outside their business. But the transphobia isn't ***systemic***, because they're employed by the state!  >and detest western culture   So do the progressives.  >and feminism   But I was told by the strong independent black woman, Yassmin Abdel-Magied, that Islam is the most feminist religion.   Or are you just some kind of misogynistic racist alt-right white nationalist who won't listen and believe a black woman when she tells you something?

9. 								When the state is not allowed or able to vet (interfere with) immigrants you leave yourself open to the demographic warfare that enables the behavior you complain about.   Without border enforcement and vetting of immigrants, the reality is that the demographic warfare is still coming, they are just going after the softer juicier targets *first*.  Both open borders and the welfare state are fucking naive to the point of being retarded. And either will eventually result in the collapse of the nation and the the ability to plausibly enforce the rights of the individual.  And if you cannot enforce the rights of the individual, it is by definition *not* libertarian.

13. 												SJW shit had... something to do with this place.  Lemme go back to the source: [this is the comment thread that directly led to KiA's creation]( This has nothing to do with SJWs.  The most common archive thrown around to prove that "KiA was always about SJWs" is [this one]( taken four days after the sub's creation. "We were talking about SJWs to boycott, we were talking about SJW influence, how is that not proof that KiA was always about SJWs?" Because you're talking about corrupt journalists to boycott, and essentially [reposting shit that was already on TiA]( at the time. KiA was effectively born out of TiA, so, again, the overlap of anti-SJWs is natural. Proof of SJW shit being a driving force? I don't think so, unless you'd be willing to say that callout culture is also part of why this sub exists.  [Here's where the sub starting being shaped into GamerGate proper]( courtesy of yours truly. "But Hat, you used SJW in that post! You talked about spreading ideologies! The commenters talk about SJWs!" Well, you got me there, everyone was throwing around the term "SJW" like anti-GG/aGGro hadn't been coined yet, so yeah, that's what we used to describe our opponents. Take [this post]( for example. Ideologies? Yeah, that's what I was talking about when I said "SJW stuff being pushed by outlets like Kotaku and Polygon," those were the main targets at the time, the places that everyone shat on.  I know it kind of looks like me hand-waving away a bunch of relevant shit (trust me, I've heard that one before), but my main point is this: The cornerstone of KiA, and the reason why it exists, is because of the exposure of gaming journalism's rotten core. That's what drove boycotts, that's what drove the emails to advertisers, that's what led to digs and finds, and what kept KiA active. The community was already mostly anti-SJW, due to overlap with TiA, but that doesn't necessarily make anti-SJWism part of the bedrock of the sub any more than pointing out retards on Twitter.  Somewhat ironically, while finding my old links for this, I ran across [this post]( Seems like KiA was debating on whether it should be about opposing SJWs when it was still a couple of weeks old.

1. Paging /u/psa_sitch to collect his beating.  As a side note, one of Allum's criticisms here is something that was kind of a world-changing realization for me when I first started doing it.  It turns out you *really can* just email the people directly and get all kinds of juicy info, or check facts, or tell them right to their face why you think they're wrong (politely, of course. Although... my emails tend to be incredibly longwinded with a shitload of links, so google sometimes labels me as a spambot). My first experience was with some of our Disrepectful Nod type operations, and random contacting of localization companies... and I've since emailed/otherwise contacted YouTubers, professors, journalists, grad students, etc. etc.  They don't seem to even care if it's from my various anonymous accounts with "itsnotmyfault" signed at the bottom instead of my real name.   I think that's one of the biggest takeaways here, Sitch. A few weeks ago you seemed shocked that I got a response from an academic via email and I said basically "yeah, people tend to respond to emails." Now you're hearing from a pro saying you're EXPECTED to send out these kinds of emails for this kind of work.   I'm also thinking about a Cernovich article I read where someone called him out for mass-emailing people in Washington looking for scoops, and he was like "you're calling me out for doing journalism? You're retarded." Warning: 50% of the article is ads  citing   Edit: as a side note I didn't dig into this one and [got into an argument and uncritically repeated one of Sitch's talking points]( Also, got a response on my question already:    Edit 2: Oh shit, Sitch DID email Bokhari:   >I sent the author of the articles an email with my questions and concerns the day it came out and have yet to receive a response.  ... just... uhh... fuck me in the ass for getting on my high horse. Also this was obviously all meant as a general PSA for everyone... and totally not directed at Sitch for what I had assumed was shyness or an assumption of unimportance/getting ignored.  Edit 3: The long awaited drama

1. It was cancelled because people were protesting the use of "Nigger" in a play where a bunch of angry white people are screaming for blood from a black man? The whole point of To Kill a Mockingbird is that these people are wrong. How would you omit that? Is "Negro" okay as a substitute?

5. 				Uh huh.  It's all a big conspiracy.  Moral panics are merely a cover story, probably planted by mkultra using HARP transmitters with transcoded backmasked Ozzy albums, in order to hide the ritualistic abuse that maintains the protocols of the elders which, of course, controls the impending magnetic pole reversal which will depopulate the world to make way for the reptilians.  The sad thing is, ritualistic abuse does, indeed happen.  Though, when it does it's almost always because some drug addled borderline personality retard decides to cut the heads off of neighborhood pets while misspelling, Satan as he practices to become a future serial killer.  ​

4. 			Well, women didn't grow tits to attract men per se, no. But breast "quality" in women is one factor that men have always used when choosing a mate. So, the women with the better breasts breed more often, and those traits become more and more dominant through natural selection. Ditto with chimps.  So yeah, women have the breasts they have because it's one of the main traits that attract human males. So they were not really wrong, just expressed it oddly.  Though chimps are actually pretty promiscuous (even among human and animal standards), so maybe less so with chimps, which would explain why a chimp's breasts are not as pronounced as a human's when not currently lactating for breast feeding.   Also, you shouldn't call someone a retard, especially when you don't know what they're talking about.

3. 		I don't think the cop is innocent here...  She pretty much had no control of her body, which is pretty small compared to any of those officers (and was therefore no threat to any of them), plus she barely grazed his head with an open palm (a slap), which wouldn't do much if any damage anyway.    He straight up punched her in the head.  HARD.    Not saying she's innocent, just saying the cop overreacted and I don't trust that guy with a gun.

3. 		I mean sure, it might happen occassionally.  But were not talking about someone actually ripping an earbud out of her ear and shouting at her.  She deliberately worded it in a way that only the most conceited cunt in the world would imagine how it works. "A man will be in the corner grinding his teeth, seething in anger".  Look at the wording. Its meant to invoke either images of animalistic. raw anger. As if shes just so desirable it turns off the human part of mens brains. Or some gollum-esque manbeast hunched in the corner muttering to himself "how dare the precious ignore us!"  AND she seems to think this is a common occurance...

6. 					Because there are a limited number of admins, and anything remotely brigade-related gets juggled between two different departments, if anything is done about it at all.  Somewhere around this time *last year* we had a massive brigade on a post, linked to from *six different subs*, with around 1500 replies, nearly half of which were from brigaders of various sorts.  I wrote up a massive report for the admins, including links to all the brigading posts, links to examples of multiple users causing problems with it, and assorted other details so all they had to do was click the links check the individuals linked, and make a quick sweep over the users in the thread to simply see if they had prior participation on KiA before that post to decide who needed to get slapped from above.  Care to guess how long it took them to respond to that post, even with a copypasted "we are looking into it and will deal with it appropriately"?  Spoiler:  the admins *never* replied to that report, and not one user we went back to check on had been suspended, nor did any of the involved subs make any sticky meta posts about their users being retards who can't read the "don't go in here and start shit" messages on their own end of things.

8. 							> Okay, look: SW is cardboard cutouts against a pretty background. It's not deep and meaningful at all. Thus my comparison, in a SARCASTIC WAY, that HP is less deep. Get it yet?  Ah, how I love the "I was only pretending to be retarded" defense.  >> It's a fairly shitty kid's book people. If you are over the age of say, 18, and it's still "deep and meaningful" for you, I'm very sorry you have to wear a helmet everywhere you go.  > "pseudo intellectual"? No. It's a critique of the books and their concepts. Nothing "pseudo intellectual" about it. Jesus. Unclench, mortimer.  It's hilarious how your defense of your pseudo-intellectualism is *itself* pseudo-intellectual. Get over yourself, your earlier comment wasn't a critique of any concept; it was just an attempt at making yourself feel better because you don't like a popular franchise.

4. 		Yes, finding someone else's activities to be weird definitely means that those activities are instantly bad.   Some people enjoy having a person stand over them and taking a shit on them. Do I find that enjoyable? No, I find it repulsive. I cannot fathom why anyone would ever enjoy that. But, if both parties enjoy it, are not harming each other, and are not doing it in front of people who don't want to be seeing it, then there's nothing wrong with it.  Btw, how's this for a sentence:  Mentally-retarded people are some fucking weird dudes and I don't like them. Gays are some fucking weird dudes and I don't like them. Midgets are some fucking weird dudes and I don't like them.  Now obviously those groups are different to people who enjoy cuckold sex, but the issue is not in what they are or do, it is in your opinion. You're allowed to think it's weird and you certainly don't have to do it, but don't judge other people for doing so.

Stop trying to appropriate our label.  >You are talking about third wave feminism and people use feminism instead of egalitarian to emphasize that historically, women have been more oppressed, not always, but more oppressed than men.  Or maybe because it's a movement which was created for and has always prioritized benefit to women, even in areas where women were better off. Unless you think male rape and abuse victims were privileged over women before feminism came along.

4. 	If it doesn’t fit their narrative, it’s “fair game”.   They aren’t interested in reality or equality. They simply just want all to cower and do thing as they say to. Like little Whining assholes.   Love Reddit as a whole, but some of those “fairness” and “social responsibility” rules are *beyond* one-sided, just as you’ve rightly pointed out.   Equality means treat equal to, not superior to. Another guy hits me, I’m gonna defend myself. Same goes for anyone trying to harm me or my family. I don’t care what gender one is or what they “identify” as...1=1, not 1=30.   There are nice people and then there are assholes.  If you’re acting like an asshole, gonna get treated like one.   If you hit someone, you’re gonna get hit back.   If you’re gonna talk shit, better expect and accept shit being talked about you.   Commit a crime, don’t expect “less harsh punishments.” Apples to Apples.    True Equality, no “gender pronouns” or other currently socially acceptable retard speak needed.   Be proud to be a man or be proud if your a woman - there should be no expectation of different treatment or feeling of “superiority” because you’re one or the other.   And there are things women are more naturally inclined to to than men and vice versa, but there very fire things that both can’t do.   “Toxic Masculinity” - bullshit, I see no mass marches of chest-pounding, genital-swinging groups attacking women...however I do see *feminist* groups basically doing those very things to *men* and they’re expected to just *take it* and *you can’t hit me back, I’m a girl*.   Equality. Want it. You got it. Stop bitching and contribute with your energy instead of bitching about stuff that’s been had since before most of them were even born. Want a talking point about equality ladies? Let’s talk child custody and child support and the like, let’s talk about that, shall we? Courts are undeniably *very* biased towards the mothers and let them get away with things that if a male did, would land them punishments including loss of job, money, transportation and more. My advice? They want to be take seriously, let’s talk about *that ladies* .

4. 			> You are biased against st women because one fucked you over.  My cousin married a woman and tried for years and spent thousands of pounds of his own hard earned money (the woman barely contributed) on IVF and other fertility procedures because she wanted kids and she couldnt concieve all that well.  They had one kid from a luck (almost 3 years of trying) and another from IVF and then she divorced him for someone with more money than him.  He gets to see his kids Weekends and maybe Friday night, and she has them the rest of the time.  Monday morning for school, they are washed, dressed, lunch is packed and proper dietry needs are met (one kid is alergic to gluten) and are at school on time, despite him living over an hour away from where the mother put them (took them out of their old school after the divorce), which in turn meant he had to change his work hours to suit them, at great expense to himself.  The mother has them the rest of the time.  Nearly once a month the kid with gluten allergy is sent home due to gluten poisoning because the mother buys whatever she wants off the shelf or just gives them money to buy school lunch.  The kid is 6.. he doesnt know what's gluten free.  They turn up to school unshowered, clothes unwashed and un-ironed and generaly get into trouble through fighting.  I Sympathize with /u/Crappy_Unidan because it is cunts like you that see the struggles single men goes through and shits on it because they had a healthy life growing up.

2. 	Because virtually no women and very few men honestly believe women can even handle the real world like men can.  Women love to talk about how strong they are, but they constantly demonstrate through their actions and their rhetoric that they don't believe in themselves or their gender at all.  They'll demand equality, and then when they're treated like everyone else with zero accommodation or privileges based on their gender, they'll cry oppression and discrimination.

5. 				No one's hurt by his drawing, the same way no one was hurt by ComicsGate, GamerGate, or any other -Gate, yet Larsen and his aCG ilk, much like aGG, are having a field day in their moral grandstanding to others in outright inventing such victims.  Either you hold them to the same standard they hold everyone that they don't like to, or you don't get to complain when that retardation evolves into the very status quo that protects them from the same outrage they use to target others.   Some would argue that this status quo has already been established, which I agree with to a point, but that is not a good enough reason to give it zero pushback.  We keep going on about the dangers of "rules for thee, but not for me" on this sub.  This a prime example of the privileges afforded to those on the "right" side that allow that to even be acceptable behavior among these people.  We _all_ know for a fact that if Larsen came out as pro-CG, the Twitter/Tumblr/all-around outrage mob would already have taken those three panels and fashioned them into a bullet to shoot his career in the face with.

1. The sheeple just regurgitate what their gender studies profs tell them. That being said police brutality happens however most cops arent the ones who will go around beating up random people which news flash its not only black folks getting beaten by cops it happens to white people alot too the problem is it tends to be white trash so no one cares. As for kill all men how about we dont kill anyone.    As a small child i often thought to myself if i ever hurt somone severly or killed them i wouldnt be able to face myself think about it to snuff out someones life thats a person with a family a mom a dad siblings extended family friends who love then they have likes and dislikes how can someone just so casually say kill all men...do they not understand the implications,  it makes me sick to think theres people out there who claim to be fighting for opressed people but just want to murder innocents to acheive their agenda. The needless violence is getting out of control ffs we got people throwing kicks at pregnant women who support pro life.... theres groups of masked middle class white kids running around pretending to be fighting nazis using weapons and hurting people... it needs to stop. Think for fuck sakes.

Oh, and because it's still not ridiculous enough, let's get a 62 years old woman to shoot guns and save the world.

In spanish all groups that arent all female are male. The same is true in other languages. All languages that I know of have different endings to words always use male for groups of mix genders.

We all think it's funny as shit so we'll through it back at the subhuman scum that think a sexual predator that barges into the dressing rooms of underage beauty pageant contestants is a good person. Trumpettes prove day after day that they're either too retarded to see what's going on or they are just regurgitating right wing propaganda talking points. You keep getting the same arguments because the arguments are still the same. The trumpette subhuman scum that think Nazis are fine people have zero to actually stand behind. The only thing filthy trumpette scum stand for is the qult of Trump and nothing else.

2. 	This is stupid. Rememberance day does tend to focus on the glory and bravery and all that crap at the expense of realistically portraying the horror and senselessness of most wars. We all know this. You would have to be an idiot not to see it.   I live in Newfoundland and people here tend to focus on a local regiment that suffered very heavy losses in WW1. It is great to honor them, but it is also important to remember that these people were essentially cannon fodder. They died for generals who didn't give a shit about them in a completly pointless a war started by a bunch of petty European upperclass assholes. The deaths of these soldiers were just numbers to their superiors. A really great way to honor the dead is to make sure these wars dont happen. A good way to do that is to talk about war and war deaths in a realistic way.   As always, the vast majority of this subreddit is unable to look at submissions like this in an adult way. Instead they have to jump on the outrage machine and piss and moan about the stupid SJW's. Heaven fuckin forbid anybody actually stop to think that maybe the other sides makes a valid point even if you ultimately disagree. It is funny how closely the people in this sub mirror the close-minded petty ideologically-driven children it proports to mock. Just different sides of the same retarded coin.

4. 			I don't get envy really. I mean just wanting certain things- sure, but I don't get being mad others have them and you don't.  Unless massive prickness, but then I usually dislike THAT person for being a prick.  Are there people who were born into nice things without earning them, AND are fucking ungrateful and I would be more grateful to have some of the stuff they take for granted? Quite possibly, but it doesn't work like that short of fucking theft, and besides it's not just the material things with these people., They stewed in their resentment and just can't fucking even be happy anymore. Nothing will ever be good enough. As for the women who think they won't get respect for doing typical woman's duties and such?  Society wide? Probably not but look at it as *quality* over the quantity. There is a saying, granted I only really heard it in the first(the pretty good one) silent hill movie but I assume it was a saying before that.  "Mother is God in the eyes of her children."  Think on that. Even a child who loves their father,  unless their mother is a cunt and abuses them or completely ignores them they will pretty much *always* at a young age love her far more. In fact in my opinion the reason they freak out so much when their mother leaves the room is they are so rudimentary minded and have lived inside their mother for so long in their short understanding. They think they mother is a part of their own body.  So ladies, if you leave your infant who is awake out of a room for like 10 seconds, it's freaking out because it wants to know where one of it's arms went. Fathers, and men in general will *never* be able to have that close of a bond with another human being, not even their own children. You should focus on the quality of that 100% pure love bond of being so much more powerful than any amount of respect a man can gain for any number of heroic and greatly important deeds.  Also he'll have to earn that respect from blood sweat tears, and possibly his own death. You just have to get fucked, carry that egg to term and remove that new human. It's easy.

4. 			You can't claim objectivity when discussing questions of sociology, though.  Like, for example, you could have a super hard-core racist write "niggers are worthless subhuman trash", and absolutely mean and believe it. Since there isn't any actual "good" alignment, or a "decency" particle, or "truth" waveform, it would be true to the speaker, and "correct" as far as their internal worldview is concerned.  We can then say that we disagree with this worldview, and attempt to convert the speaker to our world view, but since we don't have an objective "truth" to point to, all we're doing as well is expressing what we consider "right" according to our internalized worldviews.  Someone or something with a different morality and different world view would see this from a completely different perspective.

1. The way I see it, doing such a thing will only create more supporters of men's rights, so it'll be a loss/win.  You and many like you will stop posting, but many others will simply risk getting banned/downvotes in more mainstream/neutral subreddits. In the best case scenario it could result in more supporters of men's right being more active in mainstream subreddits, but I'm probably being too optimistic.   This is purely speculation, but typically when people are so passionate about an important subject like this its literally not possible to censor them all. Taking down the other subreddits will only bring more into subreddits like this. Once they are all gone? More subreddits will be created. "But those subreddits will get banned too" yes, and then the whole process repeats.  Men's rights is more humanist, and more fact based than feminism is. It just holds more weight, and in my opinion is far less attractive to extremists looking for something to help push their toxic beliefs. I don't see how banning this sub would do anything but just create so many more MRAs.

1. Women do not do romance. They want to be recipients of romance. Romance is the word we've invented for human male [mating dance]( and associated *feeling* of attraction. Note the use of *feeling*, not *reasoning*. We are animals. We've had feelings longer than reasoning. Romance means nothing, once someone with better mating dance comes along.  Once upon a time we've built homes, slain animals, collected resources to show our skill. Endurance and ability to learn and execute skills are human evolutionary niche. Romance and seduction was the ability to show we are the best available partner.  Now we buy stuff. Our reproductive process has been hijacked by advertisements telling you what is the beauty standard, and how you fail to achieve it.  [At first I've hated this realization, now I can't imagine living without it.]( Seeing the word for what it is has finally allowed me to orientate myself in it, and shape my life towards what I want.  Just as women have the ability to select their partners from evolutionary perspective, so can you. If you're one of us MGTOWS, who are not willing to remove themselves from human gene pool by not having children, then your should limit your exposure to risk associated with reproduction in current day and age. For example, only consider women who show traditionally female traits, such as submissiveness and agreeableness. Yes, I know it's a tall order these days. Additionally, make sure to commit actual resources towards your relationship only before you are ready to have children. It's tougher to branch-swing with a child. Paying for someone else's education while they promise to maybe have kids with you a decade from now is retarded.  You can never completely remove your exposure to risk of her changing her mind, but if having children is something you value, start taking steps to mitigate that risk and associated negative impact on your life immediately. Get familiar with family court laws where you live. Optimize your asset ownership structure. Consider your source(s) of income. Try to find partner willing not to legally marry (watch out for common law marriage).  Keep in mind that the feelings of emotions you have when you are with a woman you can have with virtually any woman. They are caused by brain processes intended to bond you together. Don't base the partner selection based on them.  That being said, if you consider the juice not worth the squeeze, you've come to the right place. Nobody is going to shame you for that here. No man up bullshit here.

3. 		You guys are ruthless. all because she made a quick stupid decision to try and save her own homeless skin. People who drown always grab on to whatever, even other people on their way down. “People who were saved who tried to grab others while drowning should get the death penalty for trying to kill someone.” This logic cant be applied here neither can it be applied for a case like this where her arousal was through the roof.   Try being homeless and lonely and not mad at the world. This subreddit can be a damn echo chamber of “ya fuck women!”. You guys leave no room for more contextual information. Reminds me of road rage where one person says “fuck that idiot” but would never say that face to face, for many reasons including the fundamental attribution error.

7. 			No there is “no reason to have this many people having children”... if you were designing a perfect utopian simulation.   Just saying “ no reason to have this many people have children” it sounds like some authority is choosing who has children. no one is “having people have children”.  People are choosing to have children for themselves. in reality, there doesn’t need to be a reason because human beings have a right to reproduce. They Always have. That’s how we got here. Now, do they have the right to the welfare they get because they were irresponsible and had too many kids? No, I don’t think they should.   But like, the right to have a child is about as fundamental a right as it gets, agency over ones own body, etc,..   I duno if you’re actually saying it should be that way , or jus saying, it would be ideal, in a perfect world if those people didn’t have kids. But I don’t think I’d ever say someone “shouldn’t be allowed” to reproduce.

2. 	Honestly this is a really shitty post and I don't get why it was upvoted. I like posts where the person actually holds retarded views. For example look at the top posts of all time, those are all great, you know actually insane people who don't have a realistic worldview at all.  But this post isn't like that at all imo, I think it's a meme, and I agree with its' content, because you shouldn't rape people. Yes there are problems with false accusations but op didn't say anything about that at all, maybe they agree with the fact that false accusations are as bad as rape, we don't fucking know and getting offended about something we think someone thinks is something that someone this sub was made to mock would do.

1. not going to report you because I don't think making discussion posts like this should really be forbidden, but you should pay more attention to sub rules, specifically #5  it's a good rule.  going to skip past reasons like 'we rarely have a consensus' and 'most people are moderates here' and right to the most important one:  Trying to form a visibly coordinated activist group that's explicit anti-SJW on **reddit** of all things would be retarded, given the demonstrated political leanings of the site's administration, ownership and leadership.  Your points are all valid, but if you want to push this, take it to Gab or Voat where you actually stand a chance in hell of not being deleted as soon as you demonstrate being even mildly influential.

1. Eye for an eye works only within a society or similar social construct. When using eye for and eye there most be an agreed upon limit to whose eye can be taken in revenge. The criminal, his family, his tribe, his clan his ethnic cohort, his race, his nation or his co-citizens. When it is agreed upon like in the old West that a man is responsible for his crimes it works great imo. The family vendetta you still see in Albania seems to work for them, but I wouldn’t want my child to be killed because my brother raped a girl for instance. This would create pressure to keep your family in check so I see why people go with it.   It cannot work within a multinational state such as the US. “Reverse” racism is a great example as to why it does not work. Modern White Americans are one of the least racially conscious groups. African Americans have a high racial consciousness. When when OJ was set free many Whites saw it as an injustice but they did not take retribution. When Trump was elected a retarded boy was tortured by blacks because he was White. Many black Americans believe in collectively punishing Whites for perceived crimes.

1. I've never cared about legacy myself, and do things anonymously, I don't know anyone from 500 years ago, so I doubt my non-accomplishments in life will be remembered.  However, if I did care about  being remembered in the future, I would do only positive things under my "real" name and do bad things under my "anonymous" name.  I'd do it following this algorithm.      CreateNewAnonymousAccount();     while(DoingThings())     {          if(somethingIDidWasAmazing == True)         {             TakeCreditWithRealName();         {         CreateNewAnonymousAccount();     }   I mean, unless you intend to be a great leader or general or invent zero point energy or invent FTL travel, one won't be remembered.  You have to do something astronomical for your own grandchildren to remember you much after you died, and you had better have been elected to something pretty high up to even survive great grandfather level.  Luckily, I don't have kids, so I'll disappear like some dust, unless some jackass printed out one of my rantings or saved a video and as they die, screaming and shitting themselves, their kids go through his laptop, find all his porn, and wonder, 'why the fuck did Uncle Topher print out some faggot's response essay to a vice.com article on feminist painting with menstrual blood?'  He sure was a sick bastard.

The funniest bit about all this virtue signaling is most of the people who “its all races” have never lived in a poor mostly black neighbor hood. You I’ll give credit because I have read about these chav fuckers before. I imagine the soccer hooligans from “eurotrip”  I will never forget the countless faces and the color of then on nights out where I have witnessed some fucked up shit. 4 black guys attacking a white couple yelling shit at the girl “dump the bitch and get with a real nigga” while trying to separate the guy with a couple bodies.

You could have given the award to someone who actually did something magnificent, but no. You have someone who came out as transgender and literally rear-ended another car, pushing them into oncoming traffic which resulted in a death of a woman THE SAME FUCKIN YEAR. That is everything they have done.      Woman of the year! Meanwhile there's guaranteed to be some lass that has dedicated her entire life to promoting women's rights or making insane discoveries in the pursuit of a cure for cancer and promoting females in STEM research, or many other inspirational stories. But nah, you have Caitlyn Jenner. Enjoy.      Go fuck yourselves.

15. 	I hang out here, as a guy. 70% of my friends are women, 2 of my favorite bosses are women and as a .ale, I mostly enjoy female singers over male singers, Paramore is my favorite band, listen to them everyday and I look up to Hayley Williams who is younger than me as a role model because of how awesome she is.     Sooo fuck you, you fucking hate manufacturing piece of shit.   This sub isn't about hating women, its about women coming to justice with EQUALITY to men.  Women have far long got a 10th of the sentences men have and even outright off the hook.    Fuck off somewhere else you slimey pikey.

16. 	Then block the subreddit?  Or scroll past and save yourself the headache?  Do you just click on everything on r/all just to give your thoughts on it?  Because that's kinda retarded if that's how you Reddit. I bet you find your day a little easier if you just ignore and block things that piss you off. People might be a little less hostile too if you weren't actively inserting yourself just to say things that you know will piss them off.

However, if I'm not mistaken, it had something to do with females(?) having higher % of being gay(?) and/or reacting in a different manner than males(?) when it comes to advances from the same sex(?). Apparently Tynan saw this in a study somewhere and decided to use in the game.  I don't know, from what I remember it was something retarded like that.

2. 	As someone who has worked retail, I genuinely hate how customers *behave*, and it's hard to maintain good service when you have to lube your ass up for every scumfucker who waddles over to bless your day, in the hopes that they won't complain about something involving you and you immediately get shitcanned by your store's fat tiedrone for the retard that reported you for following company policy.  "The customer is always right" corporate culture sounds good, until you have to deal with customers using the corporate policies in place, then you get to play real life "Papers, Please."  Also, you get paid nothing and get zero benefits, and your boss will constantly and purposefully fuck you over when it benefits them.

1. Was he found guilty of rape? As far as I know he is innocent until prove guilty. As he should be,  As should anyone else be. It is our duty to assume he is innocent until proven guilty in the court of law. Anyone with an agenda can accuse someone of anything. The #metoo movement started a witch hunt which is anti-American. If she doesn't like the laws in the USA she can move to an Islamic country where she can feel safe again. I hope Kavanaugh has a long successful career as a supreme court judge upholding the rights of American citizens. Fuck this pathetic cunt of a person.

So they feel like they stand up for the gays, minority races, and non misogynistic religions (some of them hate Islam, some of them love it). The enemy is the white man. But when they have people like me (black dude) who speaks against the shit that they spew, they can't call me a nigger, because that will make them just as bad as the white devil. I can't be a Nazi since you know.... I'm black, so Incel is their go to.  Which doesn't make any damn sense to me since I'm not a virgin, but hey, that doesn't matter. I say mean things about women so that must mean I hate women for not fucking me.

5. 				I block everyone who says 'this is not an MR issue'. A lot of people around here do, because it's the single most common line trolls and brigaders like to use.  Edit: And for the record, because you're being willfully retarded, the PICTURE is not the issue. The line of text above it is the issue. We don't know that this woman did anything wrong. We do know that people online tried to shame the man for it. THAT is the issue, for you retards looking for excuses NOT to see the issue.

10. 									>You gotta leave the areas around sanctuary and metropolitan cities, they barely represent what this country's demographic is.  I live in a very conservative Texas city, I'm telling you that this is very untrue.    >Nah, you are just a guy in search of a Nazi to punch.  Nope,  just pointing out irony when I find it. Punching people doesn't solve anything outside of a ring or octagon.   >Common American Culture is believing in small government to secure our civil rights and self ownership to secure capitalism.  Sounds like you are reading from the republican party's platform.    American culture is deeply rooted on freedoms and the customs added to those of the original 13 colonies. You would not imagine how much of what you see as "American culture" is really a grab bag of things brought from all over the world.  Our form of government was inspired by Ancient Greece, the Roman Republic and the Enlightenment which was brought to the colonies by immigrants from all over Europe.    >Food hardly represents principles and values that determines what kind of human beings we want to be.  Food is culture, not all aspects of culture is "principles".   It is the first parts of cultures that meld.  Believe me, there melding of cultures is what created America.   >If I eat Pizza, baklava, or sushi does it tell you if I believe in Self-Defense, Capitalism and Minarchism? No, it wont tell you that. Because food doesn't belong to anyone. It's open source. Same goes for clothing, language and hair style.  It shows that you are willing to step outside of whatever bubble you were raised in and sample a piece of culture that is not your own.   culture , politics, and economics are not exclusive traits to one another.  I honestly don't think you really have a clue what American culture really is or if you are able to due to preconceived prejudices.  But you shouldn't retard your children's ability to grow beyond your faults.

1. This meme is so cringe. The brilliance of this statement is that not only do people get triggered because they see the statement as racist but then you have the other side of the argument getting all upset because they view anyone who may find the statement racist as a direct attack against them. Iv seen like 6 posts on meta about how its ok to be white and how white culture and white people from like thousands of years ago are something to be proud of and bla bla bla identity politics.      1. Shitlords saying its ok to be white 2. Other group saying the statement is racists  3. Retards defend to position with identity politics 3. Shitlord community sitting back and watching it all burn down lol   the statement "its ok to be white" is only provocative if you make it provocative, and its designed to make both sides fall into the trap.

1. The statement is true, but only within a narrow academic context pertaining to sociological models of power. Problem is, that context is now used in place of the wider meaning of "being a cunt to someone of a different race".

9. 			Lest we forget his lesser-known poetry:  "When, long ago, the gods created Earth  In Jove's fair image Man was shaped at birth.  The beasts for lesser parts were next designed;   Yet were they too remote from humankind.   To fill the gap, and join the rest to Man,   Th'Olympian host conceiv'd a clever plan.   A beast they wrought, in semi-human figure,   Filled it with vice, and called the thing a Nigger."

7. 						> So Wendy Welfare and her hoard  No hateful shit here. Nope this is just a neutral, "objective" comment. My sides when some retard who spouts shit like this claims someone else doesn't have "integrity"  >  If viewing all women as less than you helps you to feel good about yourself  Also not anything i remotely said, you were responding to a comment talking about children and responded, again, with some insane shit about "Wendy Welfare and her hoard" and how fucking children shouldn't be a priority in a distress situation.   The fact you think that's normal is beyond telling.  >  All humans are only human. Having certain genitals, or being irresponsible with them, doesn't make anyone better than anyone else.  Again talking about children, and no children aren't equal, that's why we have very many laws and statutes that specifically protect children and serve as aggravation modifier on penalties for the crimes.   But it's exactly this paranoid behavior you demonstrate that shows off your hatred, you're obsessed with this false narrative made of strawmans  As far as protecting someone who is getting assaulted by someone much bigger without any kind of provocation, yes you should also intervene as far as your ability allows you. It's called basic human decency, doesn't matter if it's a man or woman being assaulted.

9. 							>  The comment was about families. Not just children. Assuming your reading comprehension is on par with the rest of your freshman class, I imagine you just chose to ignore that point. Families include parents.  The comment was on "families" as far as it involved protecting the child. The focus was the child, it's kind of ironic that you try to criticize (emphasis on try) my "reading comprehension" and then spout this mangled aberration of an argument.  >  **The "children first" definitely still makes sense to keep.** >  **Maybe** it should be "Families first".   So, assuming you are being forthright here,  you leave the children orphans and that's the extent of your supposed revised quandary with what he said, you're so bad at this friend.  What a miserable attempt at driving away from the point. Specially considering you then also uttered this gem  of retardation.  >  In my mind people are individuals, who should all be assessed by the content of their character. **Being too dumb to pull out doesn't automatically give a person more value.**  Such a neutral statement. No inferred despise here for anyone. No sir.  My sides  And the projection with "freshman" is cute. Do you regret not getting a college degree bud? It's ok, don't worry i finished mine long ago    > Imagine being so insecure and hateful  This is cute coming from someone participating in such a retarded circlejerk as the one that goes on in this sub and cringeanarchy. My sides.    >  Then imagine being so shortsighted you can't even see that's why no adults take you seriously.  Yeah, that's why i'm paid  for my opinion in the highly specialized field i work in, because no one takes me "seriously" . Nice chuckle.  It's also cute that you presume to magically know everything about my life, yet i'm the one who can look into yours so easily. Your profile is a walking self-doxx. Yikes, i suggest you fix that bud.  And following your unoriginal format:  Imagine being so deranged and triggered by being challenged on a subject you know deep down you're wrong about that you then devote 2 paragraphs just trying to throw random baseless attacks on the other person.

Not unique to autism, lol.  5. Yes, thats true. Im super interested in seeing what you retards say next and how you eat your own when imploding. Otherwise i wouldnt be on this sub.  6. Hits close to home, but not unique to Autism. Well, they are more often depressive and thus can suffer from Insomnia more, but still.  7. Cant deny it. Im not the only one?  8. Nah. Ok, maybe. Depends if talking to myself and acting like i have someone else inside me that constantly argues with myself.  9. Pride is a toxic thing in this form, but not unique to Autism.  10. True.   11.

It wasn't traveling to any specific trajectory.  What you *might* be referring to (idk, you're pretty retarded) is that Elon mistweeted the apogee of the second stage.

7. 						I think that if that's your experience, perhaps you're acting like a stereotypical clueless uncouth Chinese mainlander, that doesn't realize how rude he or she is being, and is pissing off their Chinese-American friends and has a bit of a inferiority-complex chip on their shoulder.     I mean, everyone knows that the Chinese have the worst stereotype for manners and selfishness if going by broad generlizations.   Which is the main problem, there are so many in China, especially older or poorer, that literally never learned even the most basic etiquette.   They are like the polar opposite of Japanese in that respect, and you can do rude things around Chinese mainlanders and they may not respond negatively, because they too don't even understand its rude... totally oblivious.   Just as a random example, had a Chinese woman just push her ass in front of me, when we're all standing in a line politely waiting our turn, didn't know anyone just literally elbows in and had to get rude back with her to get her to get in line like everyone else.   Chinese-American woman would never be so rude, as they were brought up to know acceptable social behavior.    Not to mention, Chinese will literally just spit right in front of you, sometimes even indoors or an elevator, its like WTF... Chinese-Americans would never do that.   I'll take an average Chinese-American girl over FOB any day of the week.

5. 				If you say that "toxic masculinity" is "not treating men and boys with compassion", then you're no longer complaining about what was reaped, but what was sown. In which case, we should call it something like "toxic parenting".    As for the patriarchy, the ones complaining about it are always complaining about the people at the top. When it is women at the top, the situation is unchanged, except there's less bitching.   So what they're complaining about is authoritarianism. They just get confused because they look at the top, see mostly men, and think "men are the problem".   This thinking isn't retarded, but it is verging on it.

7. 						KIA history lesson for you kiddos:  Rule 3 has been around ever since KIA was flooded with retarded off-topic threads, which was met with a counter flood if meta threads bitching about all the off-topic spam to the mods.  I was there.  I remember.  Apparently the rest of you have memories of goldfish or some shit.  Some loosely worded "no off topic" prohibitions were introduced at that time, alongside the self-post rule for good measure.  The problem was this didn't satisfy either side; people kept bitching about the off topic shit and other people started bitching their shit was removed.  The point system was introduced to clarify what exactly was considered on topic or off topic.  Reportedly, there had been transparency issues; some threads were removed for one reason, others stayed up despite clearly violating the same rule.  It ultimately depended on how the individual mod interpreted the vaguely-worded rules.  People complained.  Fair enough.  So a point system was introduced; people were given exactly what the rules were going to be and told point blank that the mods would be enforcing them to the letter.  Or more specifically, KIA discussed and proposed the new rules and then voted on them in a series of meta threads.  With transparent rules, everyone would be on the same page when they submitted their thread.  And mods would not be applying any personal judgment when enforcing them; they would remove things that violated the rules because that's what the community decided and they wanted to forestall complaints.  Then the mods had people literally vote on a new point system, because the mods *actually* enforced the existing point system blindly and to the letter, which was exactly what they had promised.  And as it turned out, the point system wasn't flexible enough to cover all edge cases, which meant a lot of seemingly on-topic shit was removed and some arguably off-topic shit passed.  Cue conspiritard nonsense about nazi mods.  Mods don't enforce rules consistently? Nazi mods.   Mods do enforce rules consistently, leading to unfortunate unintended results? Nazi mods.  This was *despite* the fact that the point system was literally hashed out and voted on by verified KIA members.  So people voted on a more relaxed point system including a return to the self post rule.  And that's where we are today: a nice, comfortable middleground after years of pendulum swinging back and forward in response to listening to those bitching about nazi mods and spam.  So no, rule 3 doesn't exist for mods to be cunts.  Rule 3 exists because the mods stopped listening to divisive, polarizing, D&C, concern-troll faggotry.  **And good riddance for that.** Dozens of shit-stirrers popped out of the woodwork before, during, after the last round of voting and the mods literally stopped paying attention to them.  Feeding trolls only makes them hungrier and noisier.  The more attention they gave these people, the more they fucking whined and bitched and accused them of being Nazis.

12. 									I've been on the mod team of two separate subreddits of decent size, so I think I can accurately say that the idea that you have to come up with a scoring system and require submitters to plug numbers into a formula to have no "I got banned from.." threads is fucktarded. For all this talk of how put upon mods are and how horrible users are, you commit the same mistake as every other shitty moderator on this website, and that is that you hold the user base in **abject contempt**.  Don't make me laugh about "transparency". Transparency by way of having all the chaff visible, maybe. This mod team makes just as many shitty decisions as any other, makes the [same anti-user decisions as many others]( and has just as many judgment calls couched in fake objectivity (protip: putting numbers next to a subjective thing doesn't make it objective), and not to mention [***five goddamn pages of conduct rules!***](  Worse, they suffer from probably the single greatest sin of any moderator, and that's that they don't think they're doing their job unless they have their fingers in *stuff* changing *something* *somewhere*.   Are people going to bitch? Of course. Moderating requires a thick skin. That doesn't mean that you go so far out of your way to not be /politics that you turn into /f7u12 or /science or /lifeprotips. Instead of what KiA could be, we get socjus-style moderation with a thin veneer of being different by way of verbosity.   At the end of the day, it's still cancerous. Being open about your shitty decisions doesn't make them less shitty, and people who want to discuss socjus/gaming topics are still left without a place to do so without the overbearing moderation.

13. 		KIA isn't just 'reddit games but not retarded'.  I mean, I'd really like for a place like that to exist, but KIA isn't it.  KIA is fairly narrowly defined as covering reporting censorship and the general SJW culture war.  It's more focused on and lenient towards games, but it's not a general gaming subreddit.

1. >  I, the party elf, spent those nights sitting in the rafters of the bar as a look-out because the towns folks didn’t like elves.  Heaven forbid the townsfolk dislike elves.  I hate players like this.  Instead of sitting in the rafters, why not throw some chairs, get in a fight, buy some rounds, just fucking role-play.  What's funny is that sulking in a corner is exactly what a stereotypical elf would do.  Congrats, you played yourself.  > . I’ve had Gamemasters, Black and white, railroad me into typically “feminine” character choices, insist my character serve food to the other male characters because “that’s the culture here”, and of course, assume I couldn’t make my own rolls because adding 3 numbers together is super-duper hard.  I'll take bullshit that never happened for 500, Alex  > taught me that D&D was a game that a particularly culturally regressive type of gamer liked to play, imagining worlds of rape and war, where the races were separate except for very specific “half-breeds” who were either rare, special, hated, or all of the above.  Welcome to reality, dipshit.  I bet you'd love A Song Of Ice And Fire.  _"Why is there so much rape and war?!"_  >  in many D&D settings certain races of characters *cannot be morally good/lawful*  Name one.  I would NEVER force an alignment on a player for choosing a particular race.  >  It is baked into D&D that those players who do decide to create multi-racial characters, are fast-tracked to the narrative of a Tragic Mulatto. Forever to be “half-elf” or “half-orc” and never to be all-happy.  What the fuck are you talking about.  You're lying.  > Continuing to privilege Western Europe as the best/only place to set a fantasy game is exclusionary, and in the end, boring.  D&D was created by white people, so obviously it features Western European stories and themes primarily.  Are you stupid?  Nobody's stopping you from making your own RPG system that's focused on African mythology or whatever.  Nah, it's easier just to take over existing shit.  Damn, this pisses me off.  > Eclipse Phase allows me to switch bodies every 30 days, to struggle with transhumanism,   Yikes.  The only person going through a genuine struggle here is the GM.  > We threw the “racial” rules out the window and created the characters we wanted to play, weird and fey-touched and elementally attuned.  What rules did you throw out, exactly?  This sounds like a typical snowflake d&d party.  > The game has changed to get closer to something I can embrace.  The world must change to fit my exact specifications, or its racism.  Or something.  The most retarded thing about all of this is D&D is exactly what you fucking want it to be.  If the  settings, don't appeal to you, make your own settings.  If you don't like certain rules, fucking make your own!  But that wouldn't make for a good article, would it, because then you'd just be like everyone else who adapts the game system to one that fits their liking, and heaven forbid that - _you've_ got to be _special._  And to reiterate, I cannot think of a single time I've come across a race that's forced to be of a particular alignment.  I call complete bs on that.

2. 	I don’t know if she’s a hypocrite in this scenario though. He’s said to her, on the record, to stop shagging men.   He has claimed that it was in retaliation to her saying something to the effect of “all men are rapists”, which is not on the record. She then went out of her way to clarify that this was not her statement, nor the intention of her statement.   That is what we know so far. She has been asked to retract 26 comments previously, which have only been labelled as “misandrist” by the OP of the men’s rights thread (which the mod warned him about, and tagged as misleading).   “The parliamentary library research, commissioned by Senator Leyonhjelm and obtained by The Australian, found Senator Hanson-Young was asked to withdraw comments at least 26 times since 2012.”  Note the above statement does not mention misandry. She will leverage it, you are correct, but that’s quite easy against such an opposition. Leyonheim is not well liked in Australian politics by either side.   No matter how people might want to spin this, you don’t tell people to stop shagging cunts in a parliamentary setting. Our policy makers need to do better than that. Same goes for if she actually said anything to the effect of “all men are rapists”

2. 	1 - even though it's smudged, you can tell the image is female.  2 - using 'incel' in a context where it's not even close to appropriate basically entitles you to all those downvotes, with one more from me.  3 - the pussy pass was denied because she tried to make the case that word count implies a male power imbalance, when it's clear that it doesn't.  She was trying to make a 'patriarchy's destroying my female empowerment fantasy' move, and she got hip-checked.  4 - How do you not get that cunts like this are never satisfied?  FFS, the person with the higher word count is fucking DUST!  He's dead, and it's clearly implied that Marvel will be the one to bring about the reset that everyone knows is coming; it's a whole movie dedicated to a woman character who's apparently the ultimate power, when most of the dead characters are men.  It's literally the feminist fantasy that they jerk themselves off to every knight, and they STILL get sand in their vagina about it.  5 - do you even know what this sub is about?

3. 		1 - it's blacked out, nothing shows its female.  2 - I'm sure that loss of internet points will keep me awake tonight and if you wanna defend those incel fucks, then you do you.  3 - OP didn't expect special treatment or no repercussions because of their gender; thats a pussy pass. Your talking about OP's feminist bullshit argument, which is bullshit but not a pussy pass as there are plenty of white knights that'll say the same shit.  4 - Pretty much the same as 3, this is PussyPassDenied not antifeminism.  5 - yep, it's against women who use their gender as an excuse to act in a certain way, which did not happen here at all. Just a feminist being a dumb fuck.

Nobody can know your sexual orientation, race or sex unless you go out of your way to advertize that to other players. YOU injected this into a place it dosen't belong. YOU are being disruptive in the most welcoming place ever, where none of this matters.  So quit being a faggot and play the game.

My opinion of you from a 10 second glance is that you’re a complete fucking nerd, have no real social life, fat as fuck, but still think you’re superior to everyone.   Now that stuffs probably not true (I hope), but that’s how I view you. You thinking we are both dumb is fair, but it’s laughable that a fat virgin nerd with no friends is calling people dumb as if your opinion matters or is warranted.

Then you can go to prison for murdering people (regardless of their color of skin) and then, when it is found out what you did (because trust me, it's always found out eventually,) you'll either get your ass kicked by the murdered parties' associates or you'll get jumped into a supremacist gang.  Common sense dictates not shouting "Nigger" in a ghetto. Common sense should not be legalized or regulated. Stupid people should not be coddled by the government.

Unless you care to out yourself as a renowned expert on child psychology.      > Girls are more docile and they are better than boys in most subjects (on average, of course).      Scientific citations needed.  There is no proof of this; as a matter of fact the SATs and ACTs imply the exact opposite.  Then of course there is a vast world of actual literature.  Sure if you go by books sold, then we have to give a nod to Karen Straughan for pointing out that the number one best selling genre is Romance Novels.  But I a certain that no one would count those among the very best that humanity has to offer.  The vast majority of scientific, academic, and celebrated works are by men.  So.... are women (who are better then men by your measure) just lazy?      > Why on earth would a teacher spend more time with somebody who willingly, dilligently and skilfully does what she is asked to do compared to somebody who doesn't?!

1. Explain to me how not having a piss-poor grasp on very simple grammar rules and expecting others to have the same minimal understanding of those rules a sign of classism and white supremacy?  I went to public school and I like to think I'm only half retarded, so why is it too hard for other adults to not write like morons?

1. It's best to not even get into an argument with them. You'll never change their minds and you won't change their behavior. They genuinely think there's nothing wrong with the fact they've fucked 100 other men in their 20's (as long as nobody finds out.) If you attempt to call them out on any of their behavior, they're just going to throw out the predictable insults about being a "beta" "loser" or whatever.  They take no responsibility for their actions and life choices in many cases, and can't stand not winning an argument and made out to look like a slut, even when they are obviously sluts.   Still, I enjoyed reading your back and forth so props!  Also it's ironic she calls mgtows "children" when from my experience it's most women who have the maturity level of a child, or perhaps a high school student.   The fact she would even post some of the insults she did proves to me she'd never make a good wife.. women are supposed to be the compassionate/understanding sex, but my interactions in real life tend to reinforce they tend to act more like this particular specimen you stumbled across.

12. 											> That wasn't a rhetorical question  yes it was. you asked that to highlight the "absurdity" of me not comprehending the "obvious"  rather be actually interested in my opinion on the matter.  that is because you "know" the answer but are unable to explain it so just expect the implied "answer" is enough of an actual answer.  like i said i cut my teeth debating creationists, the first kind of ideologues the public became aware of.  same kind of ill-logic same kind of feels over reals same kind of "my offense means you're bad"  as modern SJWs.  I know how to make an argument while you can't even justify your own ideas to yourself.  >you're pretty unhinged, maybe its time to go outside...  says the guy who talks like a goony beard man and ignores science becasue of feels over reals.  if you can insinuate character so i can I you sex offender in waiting.  >It's like talking to a schizo, you are literally asking me 'explain how the more you want to do something makes you more likely to do it'  yes, specifically the psychological mechanisms behind such a thing.  i mean if it is that obvious and that comprehensive of a thing you would be able to explain it to an idiot like me.  but the fact you refuse to elaborate on your ideas and just retort with rhetorical questions tells me you have no idea what you are talking about.  literally i seen this behavior with "right side of history' SJWs and "the bible says it i believe it" creationists.  it happens when you have strong emotional conviction with little rational justification mainly due to never thinking about the position seriously.  this results in you "knowing" you are right without actually knowing if you are right on the matter.  it manifests as rhetorical questions as a combination time staller and virtue signal  since you can keep off from having to explain yourself by just throwing the same question back out again and try to discredit the opponent by not so subtly saying "hay my opponent doesn't know this obvious thing is obvious look how stupid they are!".  works okay if you are doing a popularity contest and you got charisma but falls flat when you are dealing with merit-based situations.  >Do you really think that obsessing over doing something versus not thinking about it doesn't make you more likely to do something?  no,no i do not. mainly because from what i understand of psychology "obsession" doesnt work that way.   obsession usually refers to extreme focus on something to the abandonment of other things and often results in cyclic behavior.   obsessive-compulsive disorder is a prominent example of that as one ends up taking certain obstructive thoughts so seriously they end up forming certain rituals around them, such as checking all the locks in your house 3 times in specific order before you go to bed because one thought about burglars or dangers told you if you weren't that thorough you'd be next.  i think it also has to do with keeping some form of order to reassure yourself that you have control of your life.  anyway if severe the sufferer will slowly lose quality of life as they put more and more focus on their obession to the detriment of more important things.  it's why it's called a downward spiral, it's a literal loop that drops  down the rungs with each cycle.  what you are thinking about is more drive, which is more innate than deliberate if i make sense.  the drive will make itself known and manifest itself even if the sufferer tries their hardest to ignore it.  that's what it means when someone says they can't help themselves.    a proment example of this is the serial killer triad where if a child seems to have 3 specific traits, a penchant for killing small animals, arson, and bedwetting to be precise, may indicate they may grow up to be a serial killer since almost all known serial killers shared such traits in childhood.   basically saying these acts are in the kid's nature and will guarantee they will remain into adulthood if not get worse.   drives are the ones that can escalate behavior to be more severe as new exprience stimulates said drive more than before and the sufferer tries to score that high again.   to go back to serial killers they often graduate from killing animals to killing other people when they accidentally kill someone first.    basically the same innate drive to end the lives of animals gets super stimulated when they take a beating too far or witness the order of events that result in someone dying and they "feel a rush" as some describe it which makes them want to kill again so they can get that rush back.  and the fact they are "serial" killers because they target specific kinds of people in a linear fashion makes their victims serialized. and said serialization is due to having a drive for said specifc individual ie a type.  all lines up with the OP about more porn reducing rape since the trick is to have a potential rapist get their first rush from porn thus remain driven for more porn of a similar type but they wil almost never graduate to physical sex because they almost dont get the chance.  bottom line you conflate two distinct phenomena and thus wrongfully attribute different aspects to different factors.  and you ae too stubburn to admit you fucked up on that front.

1. Even with all the cringey dialog, I kinda loved Life Is Strange. It had an interesting story for an adventure game and the characters grew on me. But man, they're really trying hard not to come across as retard crusaders at this point. Not buying this Anti-American crap. Borders are what make a Country a Country, and I'm not gonna side with an illegal alien even if he's on his deathbed.

4. 			>Wrong call. I voted for the other guy because I believe her ideas are uninteresting, when his had.. very slight potential  Like the idea of making one of the very, very few socialist system that work in a ultra capitalistic environment like his genious idea of :  - privatizing social security  - public transport  - Destroying the CDI (Contras à Durée Indéterminé) , now your will have a contract for the duration you are needed, after that you return to unemployment state, meaning you **will** lower your standards just to be able to work, good luck having a family when you don't know when and where you will work 6 months in advance.   - Being another lapdog for the Americans like Hollande/Sarkozy, Chirac told the Americans to fuck off "looking for mass destruction weapons" in Iraq, t'was a good thing indeed, for 8 years it was more "Obama said : Baguette, you go there and you do this, yes sir!"   > her ideas are uninteresting  - Close the borders.  - Negociate with "mommy" Merkel a better deal, since we switched to € we French **lost** a fuckton of "purchasing power" especialy after the Greek fiasco and allowing pretty much anyone and everyone in Europe   - Revoke citizenship to people leaving the country to do the jihad in kebabistan  - Allow anything to be voted by a referendum on a national scale wise if 300,000 people sign the request.  - Revoke social aid to people being send to prison and the family of said person too if it's an aggravated crime.  - Stop the military interventionism madness (reminder that even if people like to slanders our military as surrending faggot, France have boots on ground in 17 countries up to this day, *officialy*) **or** if you wish to continue, give an appropriate budget to be able to have boots on ground in 17 countries on the nano budget we have/had (daily reminder France is the only European country that respect it's pledge to the 2.3% of GDP spend on it's Defence program in the N.A.T.O accords, when GB is at 1.8% of it's GDP and Germany at 1.2%)   I guess that uninteresting compared to a guy that clearly said he will "ubber-ise" the country.

1. >But can someone who hasn't experienced discrimination first-hand effectively lead conversations on inclusion?  White people, specifically white men, are the only people that has actual (rather than made up) systematic discrimination against them in Canada. The system clearly and openly discriminates against hiring straight white males and "preferentially" hires others. There are tons of funding for minorities that do not exist for white people. To suggest white men haven't experienced discrimination first hand is retarded, they just don't whine about it.

He literally flirts with Mcgonagall and implies he does the same with Pomfrey within the first 12 pages of Philosoper's Stone.  Hermione? Oh she's black. Is portrayed as white in every piece of media, cover art, illustration and is described as pale in the books.  She doesnt give a fuck, she just wants to try to stay relevant, and SJWs are the only ones who will give her that without her writing another fucking story.

1. > What’s not complicated is that there’s a reservoir of video game players who hate **women** and get off on this.  **WOMEN** are **NOT** a synonym to **FEMINISTS**. Believe it or not, most women are not actually retarded. Take a guess why these videos are popular, why people like them, why the videos are called "**ANNOYING** feminist" and not "**ANNOYING** woman" or just "Feminist". Emphasis on the word "annoying" in case you missed it. Re-read your drivel and try to find out why feminists are "annoying", in fact why "feminist" is an actual synonym to "annoying". Re-re-read it again and keep pondering why people are laughing their asses off while feeding an "ANNOYING" NPC, I mean feminist (as if there's any difference) to an alligator.

1. Call white person "white person" in a derogatory way? That's cool.  Call hispanic person "white person" in a derogatory way? Whoa, that's racism!!  Meanwhile white people are being used a placeholder for an insult. Remember when gay people were the token insult? Now, it's being.  I can just hear the kids now, calling eachother white as an insult the way people used to call others faggots as an insult, even if they weren't gay.  So if we're going off the same timeline, it's going to take people about 20-40 years to realize that they have been exhibiting gross racism towards white people.  Hopefully the same Political Correctness rules stay, and people who said racist things about white people in 2018 will lose their jobs in 2040.

2. 	To tag onto this, we had a previous thread looking at some even earlier preliminary results by the same researcher:   The researcher took a look at that summary and said that it was basically correct:    As followup, she says that an account like mine would not count as "anonymous". We should be imagining egg accounts and throwaways for that category, I guess. Morten Bay, another person who has used Twitter as a study tool, also says that Botometer is basically the gold standard for research purposes, so I'm not sure what Volleyball was thinking of when he said "utter fuckton of false positives too". Perhaps he is referring to Randi Harper's ggautoblocker, which really just blocked anyone who followed two or more "GG leaders"? That one later got used by sweden's gov or some retarded shit, really that weird of a confusion.

4. 			I mean... sure?? It really is pretty good though. And more importantly, it's better than all the alternatives...  Personally, I have a lot more trouble telling if something's a satire account or an actually retarded ideologue, even when looking by eye. Some people are literally so dumb that you wonder how they haven't won a Darwin Award. Yesterday I got into an argument with one of EveKeneinan's religious followers that lacked the ability to understand how the spread of atheism could possibly be similar to the spread of a religion or any other ideology. This morning I thought that  was a satire account before it slowly dawned on me that someone could really be that stupid.

8. 							Here, let me put it to you this way.   Every day, I use a computer, and I run Windows.   Windows has a LOT of problems, and some of them could very reasonably justify calling it "complete shit".  And yet, I use it every day, because (for what I use it for) it's better than literally everything else. It is the least shitty tool for the job, making it the best.  That's what I'm trying to communicate to you. At some point, you have to use something, and I'm not dedicating years of my life into developing anything better. Bethany Lacina and Morten Bay aren't going to try to develop anything better (probably). If you WERE trying to develop something better, Botometer is the "giant" that you would stand on the shoulders of.   Another issue is that the state of the art for bots is SO GOOD that tons of people argued with arguetron, and that's someone's casual side-project. The absolute state of twitter is SO BAD that you can get into an argument with a bluecheckmark that is SO DUMB that you begin to truly believe the NPC meme. There's people that appear to be on twitter primarily to mindlessly consume ads and retweet celebrities with mindless "YASSS KWEEENNN" comments. Look through  history and tell me "bot" "shill" or "retard". I legitimately have very little certainty. Bot detection is HARD, if someone's genuinely interested in tricking people and not just mass retweeting for money.   But thanks for taking the time to read the study and point to the more important information. I was too lazy, and now I know. Thanks.

15. 								I know what you're getting at, and I agree this woman is a fucking idiot. The problem is everyone thinks wildly differently, and people you and I view as cunts probably see us as just as much of cunts.   You can't let emotions or personal ideals decide what punishments people get. Which again, is the entire point of law and why vigilantes are illegal.

1. It just baffles me that on one hand games journos constantly barrage Overwatch for not having a woke enough cast of diverse character (when it easily has the *most* diverse cast you'll find in any game ever, let's be fuckin' real), and then on the other will go to bat for Blizzard when they try to shill the Diablo fanbase a fuckin' mobile game no one asked for outside of maybe China.  It really just boils down to "how can we hate our audience as much as possible today? Ooh look! "Entitled" Diablo fans who have waited 4-6 years (depending if you like RoS or not, otherwise the full 6) for some Diablo news are mad about a reskinned Chinese MMO! LETS GET EM!".   It's not a "gamer" thing to understand phone games aren't even a fraction of a % of what what you'd get with a fully fledged PC game. They just aren't. It's not entitled to be told your getting something, wait patiently, weather the storm, and then get SHIT on by a company that's outrageously out of touch with a good chunk of its fanbases (WoW, Diablo, Hearthstone to some degree). Fuckin retarded.

6. 					I enjoyed some minor parts of it and some of the obscure game references, but overall this series is terrible in a way only Castlevania can be. The dialogue is atrocious, the pacing is so slow it hurts, odd slapstick humor is thrown in at seemingly random points, and so much more. They somehow made the Catholic Church a bigger villain than the vampires and the night horde, Sypha and Dracula are the only sympathetic characters. Trevor Belmont is literally retarded and does nothing the entire show. It's a joke honestly. I'll still watch season 3. Isaac was cool even though Hector was basically cardboard

5. 				Varies a lot by where you live.  The more conservative the area, the more they are upheld.  For example in Alberta Canada they will generally support the prenup unless it’s something egregious like the bride signed it on her wedding day.  With the increasing liberalization of cities, courts etc though the absurd “20k a month in alimony to a woman worth millions” will continue.  Even if you live in a bad area for prenups I think the process of creating one is good for couples to do and if she strongly objects to the idea you know not to marry the bitch.

4. 			Hate to be that guy, but NZ has a [no-fault accident compensation scheme]( which means that the government pays you money for personal injury regardless of how it happens, BUT you waive your ability to sue in court.  It's compulsory - effectively, you can't sue for personal injury in NZ, even if it is due to incredible stupidity or even malice.  The only exception is "exemplary damages", basically your conduct was so awful that I'm suing you for being a cunt.  An example might be if you decided to go do your deadlifts next to the baby, then intentionally and repeatedly dropped 250lbs on its head, and then didn't wipe off your gym equipment after using it.

1. Good.   I think my biggest issue with these rape accusations is the time in between them. Like 30 fucking years? Get the fuck out of here those type of accusations shouldn't even be looked out without definitive proof.   Bottom line if you get raped report it immediately.  If you do not report it then it is YOUR fault the rapest doesn't get justice.   Also all accusations without definitive proof should be looked at as false untill a thorough investigation is done.  The accusations that have only dna and victim testimony as proof should result in both the victim and the accuser being put in lockup while a investigation is done. The victim and suspect should be cross examined Multiple times. This entire investigation should be private period. Any breach of that should result in harsh consequences.  And the penalty for false accusations should be considered a felony and carry at least 2/3s of a rapest sentence.

6. 				I'm pretty sure it's a woman because it looks like a woman to me and is getting handled really easily by the guy.  1. the woman says "please help him".  2. suck my dick is a phrase used by both sexes  3. the guy loses the person because fatty mc loud cunt decides to block the view of the camera which prevents a view of the person's face all to bitch about something which ultimately causes the guy's attention to go elsewhere allowing the person to slip away easily.

Shit was wack and low-energy and apparently got really bad right after I left, to the point that airmen had to assemble and march down the street to PT and back, instead of just walking, because dumbasses couldn't stop darting into traffic on the way.  We had a change of command, and the new guy's mission statement was "less after class briefings that take less time." He like trippled the number of fucking briefings we had and took longer *just to start* than the last commander took to conduct one. >.>

1. While Vox Day is still pushing hard for the award of "Biggest Faggot on the Internet" WRT to Gab (details on request, but they're not important for this point he makes), [he's noted something very important]( and obvious if you think about it WRT to the totalitarian tech Left's comprehensive purging of Gab, the latest crime is GoDaddy shutting down their gab.com domain name.  **There is no Rule of Law in the digital economy**:  > As I mentioned [in the Darkstream]( last night, what these corporations are doing is literally destroying the basis for a developed economy. And not only what they are doing now, but what they have been in the process of doing for the past 15 years. The EULAs, the Terms of Service, and the selling of software of a service, and the SJW convergence have all collectively routed around the rule of law which is necessary for sustained economic growth over time. In countries with strong rule of law:  >> 1. Property rights over land, equipment, and personal items are clear and protected by law. >> 2. Contracts between people, businesses, and the government are effectively enforced by the legal system. >> 3. Political accountability is high and corruption is low. >> 4. Business regulations are clear and enforced in a transparent manner.  > In such environments people make long-term investments and build large organizations. In contrast, if the property rights and contracts are not enforced and the business regulations are not clear, most of the economy consists of small family owned firms with little modern equipment. A high-tech, prosperous economy would not develop.  > Effectively, there are no contracts anymore in the digital economy. There is no predictability anymore. There is no accountability. There is no responsibility. There are no requirements for performance anymore. In sum, the US digital economy is rapidly becoming the equivalent of a third-world economy, complete with crony capitalism and digital robber barons.   He slightly overstates the issue of requirements for performance, there are Service Level Agreements (SLAs), but those pretty much always just give you some credits if the service is down for a period of time.  And this helps explain why so much of the digital economy today is focused on making a fast buck by skeezy means doing trivial stuff, most people don't have and can't get the [*guanxi*]( needed to safely build bigger.  The Amazons who got started long ago and got big back when tech was libertarian don't have to worry about being shut down on a whim, often by an algorithm with no means to appeal, but new companies?  The Z Man has labeled this business model as Slavery as a Service, from Software as a Service (SaaS).  For example, as far as I can tell, and certainly in practice, domain names are property only when a unit of the US government wants to seize one.  Domain registrars regularly steal them if they're political incorrect, although I suppose someday a lawsuit might make law WRT to that particular dirty trick.  So my fundamental advice is to simply not make a large investment in your effort.  Sure, we can provide you a set of "least worst" options for many of your questions, but ultimately you're just a bug to the totalitarian tech Left, who can and will effortlessly squish you any time they feel like it.  Ultimately, *If This Goes On—*, we're going to have to build our own parallel Internet, right down to the "wires" between nodes.

3. 		Honestly that's one of the the shittiest things about trying to educate myself or others on this stuff. I firmly support men's rights and identify personally with several common men's issues so I like to engage people about these things. Because of this, I like to have actual facts and figures, sources to point to, etc to bolster arguments but even I question these articles purely out of habit. Because most reputable newspapers don't print any of this stuff it takes a decent amount of effort just to figure out whether something is real or if it's just inflammatory cunts trying to co-opt the movement for their own shit stirring agenda. Also,  >It's not so much as unreliable as disreputable  It's definitely both. They outright lie with relatively high frequency.

2. 	I've done the whole blatantly ignoring thing before. It drives them up the fucking wall. The one I was ignoring was a terrible, toxic cunt, with a terrible attitude and permanent bitch status, but also thinks she's a 14/10, when reality is more like a 5 on a good day. You want to see them turn into a hot mess of anxiety and desperation, just ignore them without any explanation.

4. 			I used to be such a huge Beyonce fan, like when she was in Destiny's Child.  The funny thing with these "woke" retards is that they don't realize that Beyonce actually took opportunity away from a lot of black female R&B singers.  What happened to Brandy, Monica, Deborah Cox etc when Beyonce came on the scene?  Their careers evaporated, and the media machine behind Beyonce actually made sure that happened.  I know because I'm an R&B fan and watched it happen lol.

16. 															No dumbfuck the vast majority of the world considers 16 the age of consent to have sex with anyone 16 and older. I thought that was heavily implied by my comments but I guess it flew right over your head. Are you sure that you can read? A 16 year old isn't a child, getting a fucking grip dude. The fact you felt you were so vulnerable as a 16 year old that anyone 18 and older could take advantage of you and trick you into sex is your problem, not ours. Most 16 year olds aren't mentally retarded, but I do agree that people like yourself who are mentally retarded shouldn't be able to consent to sex.

3. 		They didn't just want "work girlfriends". They wanted girlfriends. Ones who didn't look like Gail Simone's awkward more obese cousin. Do you think Dan Slott, Tom Brevoort, or Mark Waid ever got to nail a piece of ass like Heather Antos without paying out the nose for it and then weeping when she left? Nawnigga. They were all living under the fantasy that they'd get some pumkin spiced latte flavored thot pussy. If not from Antos from one of the friends that she greatfully hooked them up with. The irony is that the rainbow hairs aren't wrong about there being toxic males in comics, they're just wrong about who those toxic males are. And they don't care because transferring and projecting that guilt got them money.

5. 				> You heard him describe the press as "the enemy of the people" even after one of his lunatic followers attacked this flawed but necessary pillar of democratic society, right?  "This is extremely dangerous to our democracy"  "This is extremely dangerous to our democracy"  "This is extremely dangerous to our democracy"  "This is extremely dangerous to our democracy"   Remember when CNN attempted state propaganda and youtube got it edited and in clear view within hours, and then you forgot about it?  That's why Trump says the media is the enemy of the people - because it is. Since you have such a hard-on for debating trump points, I'm sure you'd love to be privy to the fact that what CNN is attempting to do is what ultimately gave the Nazi party the authority to resettle Jewish people into ghettos. The media changed public perception by hammering the public with the same message day in and day out. It's brainwashing. The media brainwashes people into getting all riled up about politics so that we hate our neighbour.   Listen, Trump isn't doing that bad of a job. The media portrays Trump to be an idiot at every opportunity they can, and the way Trump is talked about you would think that the white house is at risk of being burned down because 'Trump will microwave tinfoil at any moment', yet the data speaks for itself.   American GDP hasn't seen this much of an incline since 2008. Unemployment is down. The USD is strong. America is healthy! Except there are a fuck ton of social issues that are being fueled by the media. Racial tensions, socioeconomic issues, immigration tensions - all fabricated by the media.   And you believe it. Like a fucking retard. You must be asking yourself "how is trump still president?!" well, it's because he is doing a great job so far, and half of the country are pleased with him. The people are pleased - not counting those who spend hours in anti-trump echo chambers.

6. 					Do you remember how investors profited off the housing collapse by purchasing insurance on mortgage backed securities?  The way that this "trick" worked was that "Investor A" would buy a credit default swap on "Investor Bs" mortgage backed security. When "Investor B" defaulted, "Investor A" would get paid.  Soros can do the same thing, but this time around, *do it to municipal bonds.*  For instance, Seattle and Portland have gone full retard for social justice. They're spending billions on the homeless, with no end in sigh. A clever investor like George Soros could "short Seattle" by purchasing credit default swaps on Seattle bonds.

1. In America it will largely come down to a constitutional challenge for the first person that doesn't settle with a plea deal. Like with the masturbatory aid bans, which were also predicated on obscenity, it requires a court challenge to overturn obviously unconstitutional prohibitions on 1st amendment speech.  Also, to anyone claiming "muh 10th amendment," that only works for powers not already delegated to the people/fed. The 1st amendment, like the 2nd, is largely inviolable and cannot be constrained by state law just because they vote to do it. The states don't have the right to curtail 1st amendment speech that is guaranteed by the Constitution at large. Just because they regularly do, doesn't mean it doesn't also regularly get overturned after lengthy court battles.  This is why states like California routinely get slapped by the Supreme Court for gross unconstitutional acts.  As a further on this, keep in mind that "nudie mags" as a whole were considered illegal in the United States until recently, as far as history is concerned. When you see people say that something is illegal, you have to keep in mind that while the State may find it illegal, it doesn't mean that the court will when forced to examine it. Obscenity laws have been dying a slow death of a million court battles for decades, and no higher court *wants* to rule on something being an obscenity or not, because then they will have to once and for all define what an obscenity is without completely trashing the 1st amendment, a feat that they simply can't do, since the Miller test is the most ambiguous and ill-defined standard applicable.  As a passing last time edit, obscenity law reflects possibly the last gasp of moralism in United States common law. The great majority of laws focus on the verifiable parties involved with a dispute, the verifiable harm or offense committed, and the verifiable damage of said acts. There is a lack of passion, or focus on right or wrong, in law. There is only what happened, and the facts about what happened. Only in the resolution of a trial does the depravity of a person's conscience in committing acts sway the punishment of those acts. But obscenity is ill-defined, lacks any victims, cannot be tied to a particular public act, and criminalizes the conscience of the accused. It is only "wrong" because others are offended by it. No act of deprivation is tied to its existence, nobody is harmed by its creation or dissemination, and it can only be illegal because the State is making a moral stand. If anything, the world would be better by removing this topic from the State's hands once and for all.  Obscenity law is the SJW's wet dream as created by the extreme right. There is functionally no difference between hate speech as envisioned by the extreme left, and obscenity law as crafted by the extreme right.

14. 			>You might as well argue that the Supreme Court upheld slavery at one point, which it did, so why argue against slavery?   And I *would* if we still had slavery and it had never been overturned and I was talking to somebody who was trying to tell everybody the courts were anti-slavery. I might provide my own *moral* reasons to be against slavery...but yeah, a discussion of the law would require me to bring it up if the person was pretending the Supreme Court was against slavery when they had actually upheld it.   >Rights are not based on morals. They're granted by the virtue of existing.  It's funny, you *say* that as if those two things conflict somehow. "It's not morality! It's just a series of rules about behavior based on a human's intrinsic worth!!"  What exactly is the reason to separate the two things, other than the word 'morality' obviously makes you mad, and reminds you of religion, which makes you *really really* mad?  >It's a right derived from the need of the individual,   If it was derived from the need of the individual than progressives would be right in saying we have a basic human right to food and shelter and all that stuff, and the Gov't would be obligated to provide it. Rights aren't based on something as pragmatic as human needs, they are based on human worth and dignity.  If you're any sort of libertarian or conservative, then you believe primarily in *negative rights*; i.e., rules about what *other people aren't allowed to do to you*, i.e, morals.   >Obscenity is the very definition of a group punishment upon the individual, the offense of others as a reason to inflict tyranny on the minority.  No more or less than any law that comes down to a group vote.  If you're going to cry 'tyranny' in every instance the minority doesn't get their way, you may as well rename judges as regents and give them the authority to rule over every aspect of our lives.   In the mean time, *Of fucking course* communities get to decide things like 'can you sell dildos in a school zone' based on the community's wishes (measured by voting), and of course histrionic language about tyranny doesn't actually change that.   >Honestly, conservatives make me sick sometimes.  Yeah, that's clear. You should probably calm the fuck down and compose some better arguments if you're going to address one in the future.   >Anyone that would lock up another human being for scribbles on paper should never speak of standing for anything resembling human dignity.  Like for example this ridiculous fucking strawman.  Here's another one: those degenerate libertarians make me sick sometimes.  They want every community on earth to look like a goddamned Bangkok red-light district, because apparently not being able to walk down the street of your home town without seeing people jerking off in public and screaming "NIGGERFAGGOT" at you is what freedom is supposed to feel  like.

1. In the timeless words of the philosopher Kat Williams: "Maybe you should start asking *yourself*: "What is it about *my* pussy, that attracts "ain't shit niggas"?"  You'll notice that it never occurs to women like this that they are the ones continuously making the same mistake over and over.  Because nothing can be their fault.  If something doesn't work out, well they're the victim regardless.  I bet she believes "I got the pussy so I make the rules" but also believes it's a mans responsibility to protect her even from herself, effectively ensuring she's immune from personal responsibility unless it's positive. That she'll take credit for.

1. There will be a violent revolution within the next 10-15 years.  I don’t want it to happen, but I think it’s inevitable.   The Communists (Democrats) are hellbent on turning this country into a “Venezuela,” which is a Communists dream country.    They only vote on race, and one of the 9,000 genders (sarcasm), and merit or achievement never plays a factor.   There is simply no reasoning with them, and they are psychotic. There are enough armed patriots that will never give up their guns or their free country.

4. 			I'm also X.  The aspect I mean to say X missed out on are not the social changes.  Those have always been present, as you point out.    What has changed, I assert, are the tactics.  We did not have to contend with a permanent state of network-enabled moral panic.  In our day, moral panics were television fueled, and only traveled at the speed of water cooler outrage.    Today, a Millennial can post on Facebook at 3:00pm and be out of work by 9:00am the next morning.  Not only because of the obvious, single tweet or posting in and of itself.  But because he or she posts something slightly controversial, and then people go digging through their timelines and organize a cyber dogpile -- thus creating their own context.  Meanwhile, many/most Xers lack that sort of comprehensively damning timeline.  I don't know about you, but there exists no online record of what I did in high school, college, or most of my career up until about 10 years ago.  In fact, I suspect like many Xers, about 10 years ago when old high school friends started "tagging" me in random old photos on Facebook, usually without any context, I promptly deleted my account.  Not because I had anything in particular to hide.  But because I could see it wouldn't head anywhere good.  (It also helped those were invariably the high school people I had spent all of high school trying to avoid, so I didn't see the value in subjecting myself to them all over again.)  I mean, hell, what we called, "Band Camp" would probably qualify as  unmitigated war crimes by today's standards.

14. 			to give a foreigners insight, who is between 30-40. those ppl we are talking about used to be the cunts every sane person left/right/up/down avoided and talked/laughed about in disbelief and disgust.  when it wasnt cabaret/comedy season where those shows were traveling amongst our universitys we visited gender studies lectures for free entertainment.  to this day, these ppl, who actually kicked me out from a uni-cafe run by them on taxpayers money for wearing a metalbands shirt ("metal is mysoginist, transphobic, homophobic blablub") are banned from the only prominent gaybar in town, i happen to frequent as i live above it. transppl and crossdressers there HATE these sjw-types with a fucking passion.  ironically, the bandshirt i was wearing was of gorgoroth, whos singer is gay :)

6. 					Once again I would like to point out where I said that I agree with you? My point is that this woman was the only one who put the window through and thought she would get away with it.   I also want to point out again that I said I know all genders were involved, dudes stood on it once the window was put through and yeah, I sincerely doubt anyone believes that quite small woman did all that damage to the framework alone. However dented framework doesn't put an ambulance out of service, causing it to not be able to help those in need. A smashed window does and she was the one who did that.   They're all huge twats, done in the name of pride for our country and its achievements and it's disgraceful from every angle. Like I said this is not the only incident. The two men on the taxi caused very serious damage and left a lot of people bleeding from the smashed glass etc. In Folkestone 2 men jumped on the front of a moving car and almost caused it to crash into a family who were crossing the street with their dog. And it is all disgusting. This article simply is talking on one focused incident regarding a woman and an ambulance window

Imagine how much money and time we could save from game design to harness the NPC code writing script?  Of course the script would only be able to spout off "patriarchy" or "I'm a real woman", but with some tweaks it could be taught to be non-retarded.

1.  > However, GOG’s claim that its latest controversial tweet was a mistake is questionable. Jumping on this hashtag, one reserved for discussion regarding the Trump administration’s potential plans to strip away trans rights, is seen as more than just a marketing tool by those who hold anti-LGBT opinions. It’s seen as a dog-whistle for their regressive views, intended to undermine #WontBeErased and this new threat to trans US citizens. But it’s just a tweet, right? For those who aren’t directly affected by the plans outlined in the Trump administration’s memo, then yeah, it can be perceived as “just a tweet.” However, for LGBT gamers who are affected by news like this, GOG signaling to those who don’t want them to exist is much more than a tweet. Whether intentional on GOG’s behalf or not, it’s seen as an admission of the company’s political leanings. And, like the CD Projekt Red tweet before it, these leanings can be perceived as anti-trans.   I don't even know where to start. How fucking delusional and paranoid do you have to be?  GOG made a shitpost using the hashtag to advertise their games. Who the FUCK things that's a secret signal to anti-trans people that GOG hates trans people? How fucking retarded are you?  It was just a tweet mistake. It was inappropriate to use the hashtag, but it was just a mistake. Grow the fuck up and move on.

3. 		Oh my sweet sweet Summer child. The retarded ideologues that created "Fat studies" do not believe obesity is a valid concept.  They believe the concept is a tool of systemic opression against Fat people by healthcare professionals, due to societal fatphobia.  They also consider "Healthism" is opression and that Fat people do not owe anyone health. ( But are totally entitled to public-funded services and ressources for their self-inflicted diseases and inability to fit places.)  And that any health problems they face is caused by Fatshaming, opression and systemic bias by doctors, nurses, paramedics...  It is entirely rooted in pseudoscience, feelz-over-realz, victimhood play-pretend.

1. Ugh Asscreed games are going to suck going forwards.  Cared about the story? Well too fucking bad. Now you have to get half a story hamstrung and catered to 'multiple genders'.  There will never be another game following the protagonist like Bayek trying to avenge the death of his son, because no you'll have to be able to play as his WIFE as well which means the story missions will be deliberately vague and unengaging because they have to work with both a male and female character, OR they'll be fully split into two different fucking missions meaning that the love and care given to missions will be cut in half.  NOBODY wins in this fucking situation. Fucking. NOBODY. The only people who win with this crap are people who whinge about not being able to play as a female.  FUCK giving us the 'option' to play as female. Just fucking *make* us play as a female. Follow some female assassins for fucks sake. Why not some Mulan-level badass bitch who fights alongside the men while pretending to BE a man? And your character is like 'wtf this sheet says my ancestor was male why is this historical character who's so trumped up the completely wrong gender? wtf?'  God I was looking forwards to more assassin's creed games after their adventure in Egypt because it was fucking great. Now I really just don't care.  Sacrifice your story to pander to the 1% of idiots who are annoyed that you can't pick to play a female in a HISTORICAL, STORY BASED GAME, and ruin the experience for the 50% who play the game for the stories and whatnot. Sure, the 49% who play the game for just stabbing people will be fine, but you're going to alienate that other half of your playerbase you stupid cunts.  UGH.

There is no sustainable future in which people will be free to broadcast anything at all to the masses (whom include the mentally ill and all flavors of bigot, from the KKK to the Democrats) and *not* receive pushback. This goes triple for anyone putting out aggressively critical declarations meant to control other people via junk science and masked hatred (you know, feminism).  You're telling us to put aside all of our concerns about the biased and hostile press, academics, and leftists who are openly attacking us and our hobby - while they colonize our communities and industry - because some of them are receiving blowback from their targets? And given sjws are targeting millions of people, is it a surprise that some of that blowback is more severe?  Keep in mind, gamergate hasn't actually harmed anyone. 99% of the harassment is just criticism, albeit frequently laced with naughty words. Maybe, just maybe, these crybabies are trying to conflate a few random line-crossers with all of their opponents because doing so is a convenient deflection - a great substitute for actual arguments and data supporting their bullshit ideas?  The sjw cries out in pain as xir strikes you..  If your declaration is that none of us are allowed to tear apart Anita's retarded ideas or criticize Zoe's cluster B lunacy until that magical day when "everyone" (aka literally all of us) is finally nice to "everyone" (aka literally all of you), then I'm happy to tell you to go fuck yourself. Because you're creating impossible conditions as prerequisites for discussing your ideas, and that makes them mandates.  But this isn't England, and I don't have to do what you say.  Incidentally, this is the same motte and bailey bullshit you see from the gun grabbers. They always claim to support the second amendment, but that support disappears the moment anyone gets shot.   Which means their support is contingent upon no one ever being harmed by a gun.  Which will never happen so long as guns are legal and people have free will.   And so their support for gun ownership is based upon an impossible premise, making that support literally impossible.

I got called a transphobe today because I tried to call someone out who said “omg reddit is so transphobic” and I said, sure let’s go to the top 5 subs and say “trans people suck” and we’ll see if we get voted down into oblivion. Then I got told to shut up because I don’t know anything about trans people.   The funny thing is that I come from a community where transgender people are commonly accepted (faafafine) and now I apparently hate trans people because I called out someone not because he was trans, but because he was a dumbfuck who happened to be trans.

8. 							You're prepetuating a stereotype that men have to be a certain way. Then you go on to call me weird? The gayest men in the world are also the manliest, so just keep that in mind. You're clearly trying too hard to appear masculine, while downplaying me, and for what? Do you have something to hide? Just shut the fuck up and sit the fuck down. You wouldn't know the difference between a thong and *briefs* if it bit you in the ass. Even then you'd have to scream "no homo." A thong sure as hell doesn't support seven inches of steel *and* low hanging fruit. Damn, read a book once in a while. All of this blew up like the Taliban because you think testicles can't be mashed like potatoes. A real man wouldn't cry in the face of any pain whatsoever. So grow up and stop acting like a lil bitch. All I wanted to say was that a man most certainly doesn't *have* to "manspread."

9. 								“The gayest men in the world are also the manliest.” Mmmm sounds like an opinion to me.  I’m not trying to appear masculine, I could care less about what others feel about me. I just think you have a disgusting perversion. This isn’t about me, this is about you being a fucking freak. I’m not saying men have to be one certain way, but pretending to be a woman is just wrong. I will never accept that, and I don’t have to. I don’t have to be tolerant of those things. I’m tolerant of very many things. I was a groomsman in my cousins wedding. My *gay* cousins wedding. But guess what? He doesn’t dress like a woman, because he’s not a fucking woman. Cross dressing isn’t synonymous with gay, it’s synonymous with perversion.

2. 	If you think I'm defending the ideology you're rather wrong, there are plenty of things to be said about that. However, I think there's no reason to proclaim feminists as a whole are all misandrous cunts like the ones representing them on here so very often. If you think generalizations about women as a whole are uncommon and downvoted in oblivion, I struggle to think you frequent this sub.  These generalizations are often inherently bad, because you group innocent people in with others for the bad beliefs you have about them. Just like stereotypes can be hurtful when it comes to progress, even though they often hold quite a lot of truth. Even things like "women are all indecisive" can be hurtful when it comes to progress, because it doesn't open up for any dialogue, in fact it does the opposite.  Then again I might be wrong here, as I often see posts when they're fairly new and perhaps see different voting scores than you do, which skews my view and experience on this sub, as it makes me feel like we did in fact move in a direction similar to what OP mentions. I do feel like it has to do with the recently quarantined subs, which in my opinion are toxic, but perhaps that's also something we could disagree on.

3. 		I kind of always assumed that it would end retardedly because it didn't have any defined end goal. It didn't have any sort of fail state either. Are minorities underrepresented? We need to keep doing affirmative action! Are minorities overrepresented? Affirmative action is working we need to continue this practice!  No thought to determining when minorities would be considered to be on an even playing field and could have their training wheels taken off. No thought along the lines of "well we've been trying affirmative action for 50 years and minorities still aren't able to complete with white people even when we stack the deck in their favor, maybe affirmative action isn't helping."

1. Saw a 70+ guy today with a 20something. he was teaching her about fine wines. "You see, the secret is that they're all the same so the best ones are the cheap ones" and she was all giggly n shit trying to do a fake accent to sound exotic.  Some cunt who I apparently wasn't good enough for when we were younger tried to hook up with me. I haven't aged much due to getting rid of stressors and some other techniques. I saw her and in my mind I went "holy fuck bitch, you're old now wtf, you could have had me when we were young" and my mouth went like: "I have to go."  I don't want you in your old years where I have to check your back for weird growths and you cut your hair shorter than a twink would. I'd have been ok with it if we would have had the younger years but noooOOoOoOoooo, you had to go around fuck all the dudes with long necks and huge Adams apples and who play in a band.  But in all seriousness dudes, hats, stay out of direct sunlight, at least keep your face out of it, sunscreen, clean your face after going out and you'll look 20 until you're 40. Then you'll start to look 30 until you're 60, due to grey hair obviously.  Not sure after that because I haven't aged that far yet. I suggest micellar water to clean your face. First time it will feel like your skin is super soft but after that it just takes off dirt.

1. [edit] shit, I misread your title. Anyway here is my quick translation of a thread on Sony US censoring JP software from one of larger 2chan aggregation sites:  Excuse any typo, shitty formatting etc. First 50ish comments:  これははっきり言ってよくない方向 I'll be honest, this direction is no good  ただの表現規制やんけ Nothin' but restriction of free expression  何の為に出てるのかイミフだし、いいのでは Dunno what it [home version?] is for, so whatever  やってしまったな PS5以降は必要無くなる They've done it There'll be no demand for PS5+  これでブーブー言ってるのキモオタだけだし別にいいのでは？ The only ones complaining are creepy weebs, so is it really a problem?  FANZAで見れるのにな Well, you can just see it on FANZA  もうsteamで外部パッチでいいじゃん Why not just apply external patches on Steam  CERO Zの基準を海外と同じにします。 海外版と差異なく一切自主規制しない。（暗転、アングル変更など） というのであれば、現時点では受け入れるけど そうではないんだろ？ "We will make our CERO Z standards the same as overseas. "We won't apply any voluntarily regulation like foreign versions. (darkening, angle alteration, etc.)" If so, then I'd be fine with it for now, But that's not the case, is it?  いい加減に自分たちが恥ずかしい仕事してるって自覚しろよ 拒否されて当然 It's high time you realized what you do is shameful Of course they will reject your stuff  Vitaの売り場がやばすぎるとか子供をPSの売り場につれていけないってほざいてた豚が黙るならそれでいいよ。 If this will silence the assholes that complain Vita displays are too harmful or they can't take their kids to the PS software corners, so be it  ゲームキューブ暗黒時代の キラー7もウドンテンニの方が規制ゆるゆるだったし(荒いとはいえ少女の全裸が映る) やっぱり一強状態だとこうなっちゃうんだろうなぁ…😭 GameCube Killer 7 of the Dark Age [? 暗黒時代] was much more loose (there were girl nudes, however crude) I guess this is just what happens when theer is no competition  いいことだとは思わんが、年々うるさくなるフェミガ○ジが悪いとしか あいつら「女キャラがかわいすぎる、ブサイクにしろ」とか平気で言うような連中だし I don't think this is a good thing, but you can only blame the ever-noisier feminist retards Those assholes say with a straight face stuff like "Girl characters are too attractive; make them ugly"  ｐｃでやればいいと思う 大体cs機と値段変わらんし I think they should do it on PC About the same price as a CS platform anyway  洋ゲー専門機になる未来しか見えんな I can only see the future where it's only used for Western games [e.g. FPS]  なるほど スイッチをフェミに叩かせようという算段か I see They are trying to make femis attack the Switch  英語って酷すぎんだろ 何様なんだよ In English, what is this? Who the hell do they think they are?  海外版ならその国に合わせてすればいいが日本版を海外基準で規制するんだもんな Foreign versions can be restricted as they want according to their standards, but yeah, not fair to restrict the Japanese version by a foreign standard  めんどくっさ How annoying  任天堂はキッズ相手にしてるからエ.ログロに厳しいかと思いきや、ソニーの方が毎回規制が酷いよな You'd think NIntendo was the one stricter on ero-gro with their kiddy products, but Sony is always stricter  PCでやればいいよ 元が18なら無理にCSで出す必要ないと思う Just do it on PC If it's originally 18+, no need to publish it on a CS  fgoももうすぐ終わりだな FGO's close to being finished  ポリコレを持ち出す奴はテロ集団のISと変わらんからな Assholes who insert political correctness are no different from the terrorist IS  マジかよソニー最低だな 任天堂に逃げろよ Seriously? Fuck Sony Go flee to Nintendo  これは本当に酷いと思う I think this is actually awful  steamでエ.ロいけるならCSで出す必要ないやろ 少しづつ浸透させて広めてけよ If you can do ero on Steam, there's no need for CS They can slowly permeate it there  ペアレンタルコントロール機能つけて大人向けは無規制にしろよ Just add a parental control function and remove the censorship from the adult version  Steamで出せばいいだけ Just publish it on Steam  サードに嫌われまくるソニーワロタ そりゃ国内でスイッチに負けるわけだ Hilarious how third [?] hates Sony's guts No wonder why they lose to the Switch in the domestic market  ゲームに限らず世界的に良くない方向に向かってる ポリコレ＝クレーマーが主権握った世界。とりあえず騒げばわがまま通るもんねぇ もうだめだわ世界 This is not limited to games. The entire world is headed in the wrong direction The politically correct = claimers have dominion over this world. They can just kick and scream to get what they want. It's fucked  いや だからさ なんで家庭用機で出すのよ No, I mean Why publish it for a household platform?  ポリコレの外圧 ＞＞＞＞＞＞＞＞＞＞＞＞ ディベロッパーとの約束 ソニーも恐れるポリコレ強い External pressure from the politically correct >>>>>>>>>>>> A promise with a developer Political correctness that even Sony is afraid of, so stronk  ガキ向けハードps PS is hardware for little kids

3. 		My family recently went to a party, and I met this new girl and started talking to her, and then we continued our convo outside with just the two of us. Later on, I told my mom about that girl I had met, my mom was so mad at me that I chose to be alone with that girl. Apparently, she had gone to juvie for beating the shit out of her classmate, and was a compulsive liar. Anything could have happened outside, and looking back, I realize how retarded I was for choosing to be alone with a girl I had for the first time. Stay safe men.

But I don't see them having to turn into hard policing of their own community because of a handful of horrible people  Because that's what you're supposed to do, if you think for a milisecond "we" the EDGY BOI GRIMDARK (BLESS THE EMPRAH) allowed retards to do retarded things, you're deadass wrong, **because** you're part of it, **because** you like it you **should** police it, or else what was yours will one day die or changes so much you won't recognize it anymore.

1. She's pretty well-known for being volatile (unlike her sister, who I don't recall ever being this controversial). Screaming at and berating the ref for doing his job (and who is apparently well-known himself for being tough) shows an astonishing lack of class. She was acting like a selfish brat and ruined the actual winner's big moment by being such a twat. I'm appalled anyone is defending her behavior.

10. 								> Yes cunt  Why? Because you disagree with me (and got caught with your pants down trying to “shame” me for not caring about kids)? Seems a little over-defensive to me.  > i was totally ok after having to abort my daughter at 6 months.  I hope you’re being sarcastic. That’s horrible and I’m sorry it happened. We lost our boy at just under two months to miscarriage and it still haunts us. I wouldn’t wish it on anybody.  > What the fuck do you know about aborting babies exactly ?  What do I need to know? You are ending a human life, and you shouldn’t.   > Or is from some religious moral high ground?  While I am personally religious, I think it’s pretty easily to justify a pro-life position from a secular ethics standpoint: this is a genetically unique human life, which within weeks of conception has a beating heart. If we believe in the inherent value of human life, then we cannot justify ending it, especially not at that stage of its existence.  > Well I hope your educating the fuck out of these kids or giving them a shit load of cash because when they're adults and they can't get a job they're fucked because 1, the US welfare system is shite. 2,  they better not get Illl because your hospital system is shite and 3, I hope they aren't black because the US obviously seems to have a huge problem with adult black men from broken homes (aren't they statistically to either die young or spend the majority of their lives in prison?)  This is an interesting screed. So, I take it you don’t live in the U.S., then? 1) If not, I’d ask you mind your own business and let us Americans handle our own affairs. If you are, then do something about it. Teach kids life skills, help out your fellow human beings. Stop waiting for the government to take care of you. 2) This line of logic is absurd. If it can be used to justify abortion, it can be used to justify euthanasia and any other type of “mercy” killing. Life is just too awful and bleak and miserable and we’d be better off if we just died without even having a chance to experience it. Is that right?  > You might we'll look after kids but as I said, come 18 no-one gives a fuck  But that’s not what you said. Regardless, who stops caring? Is this all about the government again? Does anything exist for you folks outside of welfare? Just go out and be good to people. Why does it have to be about how big the dole is? People live better on average today than at almost any other point in history. And it’s still horrible enough to justify killing our own children?

3. 		If they do still have male friends/family members, I bet those guys don't know what's being said about them behind their backs.  This screencap is part of a bigger tag team of *two* of these bigots. They immediately belittle anyone who calls them out with invectives like "misogynist!" and "sexist prick!" They don't even bat an eye if someone tells them that whatever replies they find objectionable are only a reflection of their own vitriolic attitudes.  The other one in this tag team is gloating about being a transgender woman who still uses the men's restrooms just to confuse "the boys," while sneering at men for wanting a "safe space" in response to anyone who objects to their demand to abolish men's restrooms. Repeatedly claiming that it's only a "matter of time before we take [men's restrooms] over entirely. ;P"   I honestly cannot tell if that person is trolling or they're being serious. Shit's gotten *wack* these past few years, yo.

1. AWALT ! If there are any NAWALTS, there’s a 99.9% chance they’re the female equivalent of incels and they have no smv to use as leverage against men OR they are attractive but weren’t raised in this “feminist” western society and actually value a man as a companion and not a disposable ATM. Back in the day like our grandparents’ time, marriage and relationships actually had some merit. Divorce was taboo and people actually stuck to their commitment even if they hated each other over time. That’s why you see many older couples are still together and the average millennial cunt has seen more dick than stars in the sky, on their 3rd or 4th marriage (all that alimony sure does add up doesn’t it...)

1. I'm still not sure whether her healing lodge is better or worse than Club Fed?    Men's prison, and only men's prison is bad in this country. Women's prison? Fuck, it's better than how I live right now apart from the booze.    Here's where she was being held before. It was a complex that houses a hundred-ish women. They live in cottages surrounded a chain link fence (it used to be a white picket fence, but residents complained.) There are picnic tables, athletic facilities and all kinds of perks.    In other words, it's fucking sweet. If I was a homeless women I'd commit a murder just to go there. Did you even see how Karla Homolka spent her time? It was like they sent her to summer camp for 10 years!    Meanwhile, that healing lodge is in the middle of nowhere and she'll be the only non-native inmate which won't work out well for her.    I hate to argue this, but she might actually be worse off in the healing lodge and there's a much higher chance that she'll get fucked up by her fellow inmates.    Women's prison in Canada is a joke.

The false equivalency they are creating is that "free speech" (i.e. claiming xe's gender is 'Brenda') should allow the government to force private businesses to deal with crybullies.

18. 																	I have just as much right to call you a nationalist with negative connotations as you have to go around doing the exact same shit.  \>Nationalism: patriotic feeling, principles, or efforts.  Do you not feel patriotic if you like your country?  You're either really stupid or you're being intellectually dishonest because it's a way for you to smear anyone you don't like as a nazi, which is standard NPC code execution. But at some point do you feel silly pretending to be retarded so you can insult people? Or do you actually believe that only the right are the REAL nationalists even if other people love their country and their culture?  \>I believe that when insults are tossed its proof enough that an argument las been lost.  You're the one coming in here trying to use "nationalist" as an insult with the connotation that we support terrorism and murder.

20. 									Because Islam is a religious set of beliefs that openly celebrates violence against the west and against non believers. Muslims around the world celebrated 9/11, and the idea of Jihad is specifically about terrorism. Blaming all nationalists for this is retarded because nobody's supporting him or encouraging it.

3. 		I read about half of that one, down to defining and discussing what counts as a troll/sockpuppet.  I have some concerns about "sockpuppet" not capturing people who are known by their handles correctly, but haven't read the underlying citations. For example, is "DoubleLift" or "IceFrog" technically defined as a sockpuppet? There's plenty of normies who have such a fundamental misunderstanding of our online culture that I can imagine people not understanding how these nicknames are tied more closely to a person's identity than a pseudonym or "sockpuppet" would account for. But, since I haven't read the underlying citations, I don't know. I am deeply suspicious about that definition, especially how frequently the author says they tweet.   The Russian bot thing is also a mixed bag... but incredibly small (16 total). There's one that troubled me named ThatNikkaGeeked which seems to be a... pretty serious thing at some point:  The analysis is spot on for usernames like "MarcoSo94862885" which I've seen around (and are obvious bot accounts to spam links, and often have Cyrillic characters in tweets or completely broken English). Here's a random examples that I found just now while digging for more info on ThatNikkaGeeked:    (also,    What I'm getting at is... **I actually think this study was perfectly fine**, it's just that nobody fucking read it at all, and they're making headlines based on the last guy who didn't read it. The author of the study took the work he was doing seriously and is not some raving lunatic. It's just that other people want to use his findings (which are very clear, and he's a pretty good writer) for their own retarded hot-take.   ... Found him:   That Nikka Geeked is now "The Messiah" and has nuked their YouTube   This is 100% confirmed to be a person.  Edit: HOLY SHIT, this is the most #NotYourShield dude ever. Flitted from anime videos to talking about SJWs in comics and yelling at Star Wars to becoming a rapper.

1. Savage monkey beast 
Truth:  1 Prediction:  0


3. 		I don’t see white women acting like a savage beast towards a mentally handicapped individual. Once again you see something that is horrible and think it’s ok because a some ass from the hood did it. That’s your problem and why you’re on welfare. Instead of being disgusted  of how a human can treat  someone like that who can’t defend themselves, you think of race, some say that’s a straight bitch move.

6. 					I'm not an American either. Never actually used 4chan either.       Here is the thing.  I'm not trying to push the sub to any direction, but at the same time you are trying to push the sub into a direction that just doesn't talk about shit you would rather not have people know about.    Also, do you really care about KiA? Because honestly, I have a feeling people who show up doing this are just trying to make all of us active users do what you want us to do. This is a community of human beings. Which means it will never ever be a static thing and we also have our own opinions that you possibly dislike. Just showing up and saying "UGGGGGH, you are all bitches if you don't do as I, a single rando wish" doesn't make you sound like you are coming from a good, honest place, more like you are annoyed a conversation you don't approve of dares to happen.      And also we are back to one of the main fucking dishonesties people like to spew. This subreddit is not just about games. Take a look at the top of the page. It clearly says gaming, ethics, censorship, journalism". Not just gaming. I have no idea how it could be clearer than that. Like freaking what? Should we have an obnoxious pop-up about "DUDE, NOT JUST GAMING FFS"?       Calling me a thick cunt is probably not the smartest either. Not because it's offensive, but because it's against the rules.

Honestly the honey badgers should have easily won too, especially by how sloppy the defendants were acting but the the judge can basically do whatever they want and he decided to do a quick google search on gamergate ignored the fact that the FBI said the claims were bullshit and felt his old retarded normie way into a bullshit verdict.   Judges in at the very least the us and Canada have **WAY** too much power and far too little oversight.  Hell the way the us supreme court acts is basically writing laws when they have no power to do so. Granted even with people and positions that are *suppose* to have oversight it doesn't mater if they all decide to work together to be crooked, or at least ignore each other's crooked behavior.

5. 				Yelling is aggression and is threatening. You yelled and started the entire process of escalation. It's not what you said but how you said it is the important thing. By yelling, the threat of physical force is implied.  He responded to your implied violent threats. Again, you started the entire situation and trying to blame the cashier for something that was out of her control shows you to be a cunt. There are civilized ways of dealing with things and acting like a 5 year old brat isn't one of them.   See I worked in restaurants for almost 20 years and I've dealt with customers like you all the time. Usually, they went away in handcuffs because they broke the law by threatening with implied violence, trespassing, and harassment. All of those things are criminal charges, so anyone that responds to your actions is doing so in self-defense. You are the one that is the aggressor and violated numerous laws in your temper tantrum.   PS: I also worked security in a city where you are licensed and trained by the local police department to be a reserve police officer while on duty. So you are getting advice and perspective of both a restaurant manager and a security officer.

1. This is something that echoes a bit with me as you see the same thing between tech industry and science. Employers love to write off long work days to be something proud about but to me it's really exploitable and just a deep flaw of various cultures (it's a global phenomenon, really). On reddit, far too often when I warn peope to not simply accept working 60+ hours on a 40h a week contract, they get very defensive and claim everyone else is lazy.  The 40h/week standard is that way for a good reason. You need a healthy work-life balance. You will likely be busy enough just having a household and aside from that your brain and body need to rest. To deliberately push your body beyond without receiving extra payment and the choice to refuse is exploitation. But it not this way, especially not for startups in science and tech both and also academic positions, already starting at the PhD level. Hell, I too am expecting to graduate with my doctorate in a little over a month, but I for sure had 50-60h on average for a 40h a week contract. It is the norm despite seemingly scamtastic.   Two things need to happen: we need to stop glorifying destroying yourself physically and mentally for the pockets of your employer and people need to unionize more or start getting more with programs which protect worker's rights. Germany has good unions, but the same cannot be said of france, NL and the US. And especially for you americans out there: I as a european cannot believe that you can find work without having a legal contract! Making it mandatory to have a contract should be the first step in making things better. A contract is not there to limit you. It is a way to protect your rights and prevent your employer from exploiting you. You have a legal document you can at all times refer back to and nobody can debate it.   In france (and I think NL too) at the very least for overtime you are obliged to be paid extra. People I know let me know that sometimes they are send home after their 8h shift is over purely due to the fact that the employer does not want to pay them more.   Edit: Due to some comments on this: Of couse it's very reasonable to have a crunch busy period and expect to work a lot, then have periods where you are not busy at all. I am not saying we shouldn't ever have crunch periods. However, we should avoid them when we can and not encourage employers to chronically understaff because they know they can get away with long term giving people 60h work weeks on 40h contracts.

Yeah, sure, let's pretend that most people have super-duper jobs, ignoring that according to [Forbes]( the list of most common jobs goes like this:  1. Retail salesperson  2. Cashier  3. Food preparation / serving  4. Office clerk  5. RN  6. Waitstaff  7. Customer service rep  8. Laborer / Freight mover (manual)  9. Secretaries and assistants  10. Janitors and cleaners  I don't see employers trying to outbid each other competing for clerks or manual laborers... "I will give you 3 weeks of paid leave! And I will give 4! And I will give 5 and 10 sick days!" — never happens. In fact, I'm pretty certain that people in those jobs cannot negotiate jack shit, instead they are shown the door at once, and somebody else is hired in their place.  > And where is this magical elsewhere?  Literally any other country in the developed world, and even many countries among the developing ones.  > Do you .... not understand the concept of people working for their own opposing interests? Do you not understand the concept of no one owing you a job? Were's the business magically getting enough money to offer all your magical benefits?  I don't see EU dying out because all employers go bankrupt since they have to provide around 4 weeks of paid leave and suchlike "crazy benefits".  > Welp, they should have planned better. This is why you read the fine print of your catastrophic health care plans. I'm covered after 50k, 100%, with no cut off point of services. Which medicare / medicaid in the US has, LMAO. MUH LIFETIME CHARGES.  And another nice "debater". Yep, it's fucking nice to be fully covered. Those lesser humans can go fuck themselves. Go learn about the [veil of ignorance]( maybe you'll figure out something.  > Freedom is scary.  Only in the US someone would vehemently defend the custom of having everybody raped anally throughout the working week on the grounds that in some lucky cases that led to formation of happy gay couples.

12. 											> Oh no, it's retarded, like the socialist that thinks unemployment is low because everyone's working multiple jobs.  The meaningfulness of unemployment rate wholly depends on the definitions used for "employed" and "not employed". I personally would exclude such working poor as walmart employees, because ultimately they are still living at the taxpayers' expense, at least partially. It's great for walmart, because they spend a lot less on wages, but very bad for the country because it's mooching off resources better spent on something else, not to speak of the fact that such workers cannot properly participate in the economy as consumers.

1. >"Players can shoot, rob, talk to, and beat up almost any character they see, which at times leads to surprising outcomes."  Yeah, just not sleep with any of them..  ...  >"but it's worth thinking about what these open world players allow players to do, why, and how they correspond with what's happening in the real world. "  Oh boy.. here we go..  ...  >"It's important to note that despite Red Dead Redemption 2 giving players a lot of choice in how they approach situations and many activities to partake in, it doesn't literally let them do anything..... This means that despite any thoughts that Rockstar Games might have about Shirrako’s video, the ability to punch and kill a suffragette in Red Dead Redemption 2 **is something that the studio deliberately chose to put into the game**  >I haven't finished it yet, but I doubt that Red Dead Redemption 2 has anything profound to say about women's rights, and I doubt that it is advocating that type of behavior, in-game. **I only know that it allows it,** while not allowing other things."  Here we go with the argument that the act of giving choice is always at least as bad as the worst possible choice you are "allowed" to make. (i.e. "Freedom = oppression" double think/speak)  ...  >"I don't think video games **alone** can be blamed for real-world violence, but they are a part of our cultural infrastructure that **allows** someone to **roleplay** as an anti-feminist murderer (a very **real**, ongoing problem in the real world), upload a video of it to YouTube for profit, and allow others to use that video as a jumping off point to discuss how much they hate women in the real world."  And there we go.. Proof that these dicks and twats never were actual gamers and don't get it. (the games = violence myth is something gamers had to fight really hard for many years.. and now here we are again.. along with sex.. another thing we fought for years to finally open up and allow)  --  On a side-ish note...   >"**Players can't, as far as I can tell, sleep with sex workers, even when they offer their services.** Rockstar Games also chose not to include the ability to kill children in Red Dead Redemption 2"  A fact that is not only very disappointing and more than a little disturbing.. but also VERY worrying given RS's recent admission that they are too scared to make GTA6 right now.. for fear of backlash from people who don't and won't ever even play the games! I mean we had **full frontal male nudity** in GTA4, but it took till GTA5 for just breasts at strip clubs (and OC fully nude in-world male NPCs as well) I'm starting to have really bad feelings about GTA6.. if we ever get it and it's not MMO trash.

2. 	Come back in 10-20 years and say the same thing then, then I’ll listen. Most men who got shat on would have said the same thing as you in the first few years of their relationship; later they only have bad things to say about her. Going by how you feel now and how she is now is gullible. Women always behave differently at the start of relationships, and they always change years down the line.

6. 					>And there definitely is misogyny here, don't bs me.  No, it's men realizing that the entire system is misandric and set up to kill them. Stop being a blue pill simp.  >The fact that there are more divorces now is just linked to the fact that women now have access to jobs and can provide for themselves,allowing them to escape shitty marriages, which is a good thing imo.  I want you to prove this with actual data. Go ahead prove to us that women divorce because they have jobs when the stats say that they are the most unemployed and on public assistance.  > The biggest mistake people do is getting married too early, after 1,2 or 3 years together, without even living together prior to wedding.  Funny but all the studies say otherwise.  >[Since the 1970’s, study after study found that living together before marriage could undercut a couple’s future happiness and ultimately lead to divorce. On average, researchers concluded that couples who lived together before they tied the knot saw a 33 percent higher rate of divorce than those who waited to live together until after they were married.](   So why the lies?  >That's why I'm gonna take all the time I need, to be sure it will work.  If you cohabitate with a woman and you aren't married that depending upon your residence you have fulfilled being married under common law. She can then legally use the lawfare state, set up to kill you, and remove you from your own home while throwing you in prison. More and more judges worldwide are handing out judgments that state that because you cohabitated together as a married couple you are married regardless if you have a license or not. She is now entitled to half your stuff and there is nothing you can do about it other than to eat a bullet. If you are mandated to pay alimony and you miss several payments you end up in prison. Good luck getting a job that pays well with a prison record.   If you have kids with her and miss a payment you go to jail for it under the deadbeat dad's laws. Funny how she can miss child support payments and not go to jail. Again, good luck trying to get a decent paying job with a criminal record.  See I'm not being mean to you. I am giving you the harsh reality that society and the government is set up against you. You are a cog in a machine that is designed from the ground up to kill you if you fail your obligations to women.

18. 													We don't hate women. We hate the system that hates men and kept going at the whims of women. Men are slaves to the system and you support slavery. Only men can be drafted and forced to serve in a war in order to have rights. In the US, if you fail to register for Selective Service you can be put in prison and denied all sorts of things like student loans and the ability to go to higher education. You could also be denied home loans for failing to register while all a woman needs is to be born and have a vagina. Sounds like equality right?   Shall we reject the statements from slaves and only listen to the slave owners? That is what you are saying moron.

2. 	Eh... they're basically saying that their motives were political rather than genuine dislike for the movie. Were that the case, I would understand them claiming that the bad reviews are illegitimate. But I don't believe that to be the case. I believe it was a really bad movie that lots of people hated, lots of people loved (probably because they are political activists ironically) and a few people were luke warm on. They literally went out of their way to shit all over the OT characters who so many Star Wars fans loved and grew up with. I'm not a big SW fan, but if they did this shit to LOTR I'd be just as fucking disgusted as they are. The fact that they didn't even dedicate a moment of the movie to Luke finding out Han was dead and his reaction to that is a fucking disgrace. But it would have made Luke a somewhat sympathetic character and they were all in on making Luke a fucking retard loser so that Rey can look good by comparison, just as they did with all the others OT characters for the same purpose. For that reason alone, I have no idea how they didn't expect a large portion of the fanbase to absolutely hate this movie.

3. 		>New immigrants tend to cluster, but their kids tend to mingle.   The link you posted does not reinforce this point, it merely says more people intermarry, but that is easily correlated with a rise in other ethnicities and the trend of whites to become a national minority. The percentage of marriages is actually not that impressive when you compare it to the disproportionate rise in non-whites. It would be a valid argument if the demographics stayed the same. As it stands, 1 in 10 married people being interracially married is actually a really poor number.  >And despite the propaganda spread around here and Fox News, immigrants tend to commit less crime than native-born  Depends on the immigrants, not all immigrants are weighed equally. This is the part people like you always forget. For example, Jamaican and Haitian immigrants commit way more crime than Dutch and German immigrants. Literally zero people on the Right are claiming all immigrants are the same, but it is statistically more likely for Mexican immigrants to commit crime than Japanese people. Those are numbers you cannot debate, which is likely why you strawman the conservative position.  >communities with higher immigration levels tend to have less crime overall.   Not necessarily, poor Jews commit way less crime than poor Blacks. We can find all sorts of exceptions. Rich Arabs and Muslims tend to amplify their backwards and regressive views, money has little to do with it. If that were the case, Saudi Arabia wouldn't be the World's Richest Hellhole.  >Those pesky facts: guess diversity really is strength.   Once again, you people don't actually understand the points being raised by the Right. When immigration control is right - like it was in Canada until just recently - immigration is a net benefit. Again, *literally zero conservatives say otherwise.* Canada has one of the most restrictive immigration programs on the planet. The United States had the same. The United States, and Donald Trump, have never once claimed immigration is bad. Never once. What they say is unchecked and unvetted immigration is bad. And it is. This is the problem with Mexico. By the way, Mexico agrees with this which is why it is so restrictive with Guatemala. Donald Trump wants to make America's immigration policy more like Canada's.  Diversity *for the sake of diversity* is not a strength. That is retarded. There is absolutely no data to back that up. If you believe so, you will have to explain to us how blacks, jews, and indians have different brains than whites. You'll have to explain how *on a genetic level* they are different, as well as cultural. To argue for diversity being a strength, you are in fact arguing for racism.   Here's a spoiler for how this is going to go, though: once you codify these racial differences, you will be able to chart them based on higher value and lower value. You cannot say "this is different" without also assigning a relative value to it. Once you do that, we will be able to have a conversation about which immigrants are *better* than others.   So, go ahead.

6. 					> In fact, conflicts are worse than ever before.   No, they aren't. We're actually experiencing an unprecedented peace.     Where are you getting your information from, the fearmongers at Fox, Brietbart, and Rebel?  > The thing you fail to recognize is that everyone subconsciously understands this ranking of races that I just outlined, and that even within the small minority of interracial marriages they overwhelmingly trend towards people who are genetically white, or appear more white.  The original question was simply whether different ethnicities are mingling or staying clustered, and the INCREASING intermarriages shows they are in fact INCREASINGLY mingling. You challenged my claim, but you're not addressing that point at all.   What you're doing is injecting your own White supremacist argument, which also misses the point.   Marriage is largely an economic decision, and since economics have artificially broken along ethnic lines, we would expect preferences for stable economic partners to manifest as preference for "Whiter" spouses. Likewise, if Blacks are being persecuted with so many of their young men thrown behind bars and denied equity in society, then that likely artificially affects their desirability as mates. This economic factor would explain why Black men with more education intermarry more.   Or, a culture of racism (even subconscious) rather than accurate ranking might cause people to prefer White mates. How many families explicitly/implicitly make it difficult for someone to bring home a Black gf/bf?   Or, there are just more White people.   But whatever the reason, they are mingling, so my point stands.   What your argument also fails to address is the fact that, until fairly recently, plenty of genetically and apparently similar groups, like the Irish and Italians, weren't considered White. And South Asians, who are genetically Caucasian, aren't usually considered White. Therefore, "Whiteness" itself is largely a social construct, not some inherent ranking system like you're saying.   > I guess racism is correct.  At least you have the courage to say what you believe. A shame you lack the wisdom to see you're wrong.   Seriously, though, does it frustrate you that more people who agree with you aren't willing to be honest about what they believe? Some people seem more offended at being called racist than they are at actually being racist. Do you feel that r/metacanada is a place where your beliefs are generally supported? If not, then why not?   > Wrong, inequality is not an analog measure, it is an infinite fractal and inadmissible as a scientific ranking.  I could have been more precise in saying economic inequality within communities drives crime, which is the consensus among the research.   > It showed that for violent crime the impact of inequality is large, even after controlling for the effects of poverty, race, and family composition. Although most crimes are committed by the most disadvantaged members of society, these individuals face greater pressure and incentives to commit crime in areas of high inequality.     (is that link better?)  Do you have any actual peer-reviewed, credible research to show that ethnicity itself drives crime? While you're looking for that, you'll notice the consensus agrees with me.   > Yeah, because increased police presence is an deterrent to crime.   Perhaps, but the best way to predict the size of a police force in Canada is the presence of minorities, not the actual crime rate. That means the reason for the increased presence isn't to deter actual crime, but to respond to an imagined threat of crime that does not actually exist. Completely the opposite of what you're saying here:   > BECAUSE THE INCREASED POLICE PRESENCE IN MINORITY AREAS IS BECAUSE THOSE MINORITIES COMMIT MORE CRIMES.  You're simply asserting what you're trying to argue (begging the question) which is the opposite of what the evidence clearly says. Why do you keep dodging the point at hand?   Baltimore only shows how inequality with corrupt police create a vicious cycle of violence and mistrust. The police there intentionally made their communities more dangerous to prove their own value. It's like when police stop writing tickets to starve the government of funds during labour disputes. That's simply self-serving stupidity, not a case against the expansive research on the actual causes of crime.   > You did not. Multicultural cities have more crime, especially interracial crime. Especially crime where blacks assault whites and other blacks. They are uniformly more violent than every other race and ethnicity. Stop sidestepping this blatantly obvious fact.  That's not true at all. I keep giving you evidence, and you respond with invective. Toronto is both one of the most multicultural cities in the world, and one of the safest.   Take a look at some recent data from across Canada. The top of those lists aren't the most multicultural places. They are places like in Alberta where they rely on boom/bust economies, which exacerbate economic inequality.     > The data shows otherwise.  No, you're just refusing to look at the data that doesn't fit your worldview. You're being uncritical and dogmatic.   As for the benefits of diversity:   > Diversity is a key driver of innovation and is a critical component of being successful on a global scale. Senior executives are recognizing that a diverse set of experiences, perspectives, and backgrounds is crucial to innovation and the development of new ideas. When asked about the relationship between diversity and innovation, a majority of respondents agreed that diversity is crucial to encouraging different perspectives and ideas that foster innovation.     > You literally said diversity is a strength, you fucking retard.  But I said, as you quote but don't seem to comprehend:   > I'm not saying "diversity at all costs,"  Saying something is a strength doesn't mean that you want it AT ALL COSTS. It's generally good to be strong, but not if it means taking steroids that will shrivel my balls up and make me emotional and aggressive. Diversity is strength, but that doesn't mean we should place incompetent people in important positions just to satisfy diversity quotas. It means, everything else equal, it's generally better to have diverse skills, backgrounds, and perspectives.   The data -- if you don't shy away from it -- shows that to be true.

7. 				> If you think that ethnicity itself drives criminal behaviour, then you're being blatantly racist. Crime rates are driven by inequality, and inequality often breaks along ethnic lines. That's the only reason there is any correlation between crime rates and ethnicity.   It has been repeatedly shown that poverty does not cause crime, it's the culmination of culture and poverty.   And yes, on average, there are IQ differences between races, and no, IQ is not some culturally constructed measure that discriminates.

5. 				I'm not offended at all stop apologizing. And what you are discussing are learned traits. Children don't come out of the womb as cunts they are taught to be that from their mother and weak simp father or no father depending on their background. A strong man with good morals and responsible upbringing would create children far better than the ones we have now. But their job is even tougher. Because they also have to make their children resilient to the society that breeds th children you talk about. Giving them the temptation to throw their upbringing away. It's not impossible but only for the men up to the challenge. For most it is not a risk they are willing to take. I'm not up to that risk so I won't but I'm not going to sit here and act like children are inherently bad. Otherwise how do you explain me? I was raised in a terrible environment but I managed to navigate that and not become the type of guy I hate. Though I didn't become the guy I wanted to be which is why I'm working very hard now to obtain that and joined MGTOW in the first place. Statistically this shouldn't have happened fore but it did.

2. 	Agreed entirely.  There are also many SJWs that have, or have substantial respect for, pagan and otherwise non-Christian religions. Many SJWs hold quite a few superstitious/mystical and otherwise new-age beliefs. Plus, SJWs are inclined to believe that science and reason... the values Dawkins champions... are cis het white male conspiracies to oppress everyone else.  They aren't hyper-secular in any way.  I wouldn't even go so far as to say they're necessarily anti-Christian in particular. They seem totally okay with theologically liberal Christianity or with Christians that don't oppose their policies.   What they really hate is the Christianity believed in by "the rednecks/the bitter clingers".

1. Rape is a fucked up crime, but feminists have waaaay inflated the frequency of it by pretending that every accusation is a legitimate claim. Studies in Europe have shown 80-90% of rape accusations to be full of shit, so those low conviction rates actually make sense when you consider that. There is no rape culture, nor a rape epidemic. It's a despicable crime, but it isn't anywhere near as common or endemic as it is pretended to be.

1. "I don't think he's a comedian""I don't believe it was a joke"  ​  Listen, lady, I know you're a white liberal woman so you're used to being catered to but it DOES NOT MATTER what you "believe" or "think" about a person who says himself that it *was* a fucking joke. Any person with 2 brain cells to rub together knew that pug video was a joke. And no, a person does not need to be a card-carrying Comedian™ to make a fucking joke. The beauty of humor (not that you'd recognize it if you heard it) is that anyone can tell a great joke. You don't need a stand-up routine or time on stage to make people laugh.  ​  This chick is a self-righteous and humorless twat who can take her judgmental attitude and shove it up her ass.

I know that's difficult for someone like yourself to understand, low-IQ, community college food service tech certificate and all. I was Army, USASCOC, etc.   Or maybe you just like being a bitch to Russian male GRU agent types. Pity you're on your knees in front of Russian cocks all the time.

1. Real talk for a second... What I've noticed is that black people who are older, maybe 35 plus? Idk about the exact age, but they I know that these black people are totally respectful and make you forget racism ever existed. Like they are the realest people. The black youth though that subscribes to this disrespectful modern rap culture (by disrespectful I mean in general, sure there are still good rappers but rap today is 90% negativity or egotistical or both) is actively trying to revive racism. They hate white people for no good reason because they are living in an age where equality exists more than ever, and they just wanna be haters basically. Then the same people will say "fuck haters man". Like ok.... keep doing you. At the end of the day I keep living my life by my own moral code which is being respectful of everyone unless they give me a reason not to be, but it can't help but sadden me a bit when I see how the black youth (again generalizing) seems to try and fuel more racism through hate, ego, pompous attitude, etc.

9. 								I often tell my employees that I expected better of them, and give them tasks far beyond their capabilities. Knowing that if they have the drive/initiative to succeed that they will work triple the pace and push far beyond their own limits. Those who can't wash out quickly and save me the trouble of letting them build seniority.  I'm a bully in most senses of the word, but I reward them properly when they do well to compensate. My job requires taking a bunch of 19 year olds with no world experience and making them work at 150% the minimum, because our corporate is literally retarded in how they translate work to hours allowed.

5. 				In other words she's not criminally responsible for not asking for ID, because they wouldn't use ID since they were already breaking the law  If she's in the kind of profession where it's already illegal, that just means she committed to crimes: fucking a minor, and selling sex. And somehow in that tiny brain of yours that equates that she shouldn't be punished for anything. Of all the arguments for giving this cunt a Pussy Pass, that's the most idiotic

1. They've definitely gotten more vocal and aggressive and it's working. The Simpsons is writing out Apu already after that hack comedian's hatchetjob for example. The Simpsons of all shows, a show which gained popularity for its irreverent portrayals of all sorts of races and stereotypes is is writing out a character because of a vocal minority.  This is going to keep happening. And it's going to keep happening because a lot of people just dismiss social justice warriors as a powerless minority. Hop on over to subreddits like news and you'll see most posters disregarding social justice warriors as a problem, saying things like universities shifting to the far left are a minority all the while spouting off some social justice warrior talking points without even realizing it. The deluge of bullshit from the mainstream media has already turned many people into sheep without them realizing it.  I'm sure most people don't agree with this type of behaviour and thinking but they also don't speak up or care to criticize it. If they did agree then Trump wouldn't be in office right now. The problem is, everyone and everything is so polarized now. It's far left this, far right that, there's nobody in the centre just telling both sides to chill the fuck out and offering new solutions. Everything has to be partisan and extreme, everything has to be either white nationalist nazi militias or antifa death squads roaming the streets. Holy fuck, chill out.

True or untrue, and all of it only reflects from her FIRSTHAND OBSERVATION. The only time she's ever seen a man "be good" is when he's being good - to her. That is her reference point of a "good man"  She's never been good... Just a slut. When a woman "is good" she's on the prowl.  Women use "good" as a way to define performance not demeanor or mood

1. So the legal argument here is whether 'private womens locker room' could be construed as not to include people who were assigned male at birth. So by this logic, Buck Angel would be perfectly welcome in her locker room because he's got a vagina? Somehow I don't think she'd welcome him there. So then what if a bigoted dude says he doesn't want anyone assigned female at birth in his locker room, so Buck can't go there either? This is fucking retarded.

1. I hate to be that guy, but I could tell her wild story of being raped by 9 men was untrue just by looking at her photo.   Edit: To clarify, of course unattractive people get raped. What I meant was is that you dont get sexually assaulted by 6 and raped by 9 in 3 years (Or about once every 2-3 months) looking like the stay puft marshmallow man.

2. 	A black dude was trying to get into his own apartment. It’s one of those upscale places so “one of those negros” living there was off to her.   It was his fucking apartment, and she blocked him, and called the cops when he brushed past her walked in. Then the cops told him she felt “uncomfortable with him being there.” The Starbucks thing is a different racial issue, but this one most certainly is worse and shouldn’t even be a question.   She got fired for being a fucking psycho, and she’d still have a job if she wasn’t a racist and had minded her own business. Maybe it’s harsh, but when you live in a world where everyone has a way to record you in their pocket, maybe you shouldn’t be such a fucktard in public.

Whats good about this is they also believe in only the retarded boomer docs who throw everyone on opioids rather than taking a good history and finding the root of the issue of their health problems. I refuse to see boomers and they refuse to see me which is fine because i dont want their generation lingering around any more than i have to suffer through. My parents were fine and every now n again i meet an aight boomer but the vast majority im happy to see go. Might sound harsh and yes im a doc who doesnt believe anyone should suffer but when the entire generation fucks mine over, its gloves off unless you prove yourself to be a decent human being. Cant be nice to cancer and think itll heal itself same thing with generational cancer.

4. 			You're not really allowed to say this but you are right.  Women tend to have more 'juvenile' features because of selection by men over thousands of years.  For example, most men prefer a hairless body on women, so those women who are less hairy were always more successful when it came to reproducing and today there are very few women with really hairy bodies, but still plenty of men like that.  Probably why women in porn always have shaved cunts etc.  Peadophilia has been common in many cultures and remains so to this day in some parts of the world. Muslims worship their prophet who was known to be a paedophile, taking a wife who was like 6 years old.

1. Not a mens rights issue. Nobody is forcing the bloke in the picture to hand over his jacket at gunpoint, so his rights aren't being violated. Societal pressure is not an infringement of your rights, and to claim it makes you just as bad as the feminists I'm sure you all dislike.

1. It’s painful to see the cop as the fail or partial fail in these body cam vids. Pretty rare, but this guy was kind of a douche and not really having good control of his emotions.  I don’t even mean the tasing either...once arrest mode is engaged, gotta just comply. It’s the escalating and kind of knee jerk reactions to her being sarcastic.

7. 						No, it literally wasn't, as they have the same skull size and shape. As there is no difference between the two it cannot be used to suggest the superiority or inferiority of either. Similar arguments have been made to suggest that blacks are inferior but I'm not making those arguments and the fact that shitty arguments have been made using good data doesn't taint the data, only the shitty argument.   The Attorney General from the previous administration once said that we are a nation of cowards in part because "we, average Americans, simply do not talk enough with each other about things racial.” Fuckers like you are why. You don't actually read what people write, you don't check the sources provided, and you don't do any research or thinking on your own. You just take something you vaguely remember some other cunt saying and paraphrase it for the sake of pointing a finger at somebody who is having an honest conversation.

3. 		THEY DO! When a woman is tring to tell you to eat 'healthier' she is trying to remove PROTEIN/RED MEAT. She is essentially lowering his libido/testosterone. I've quipped "They want to remove the red meat because he might want a blow job after dinner".  Women treat men like dogs. They decide when they will reward and punish certain behaviors. The problem is that the female will start removing too much from him until the dog gets really hungry and breaks. Maybe its booze, maybe its cheating/sex, whatever it is, then they will blame him. When really they were starving the dog until it started pissing in the corner and then they punish the dog for peeing in the corner instead of giving him what they know he wants/needs.   Women treat dogs better than men. A woman will tell you to never punish your dog. They will say you can only 'reward' positive behavior. But they only do that in the beginning with a man. Once the dog is doing what it's 'supposed to do' 98% of the time, they are bored and lose interest and then neglect the dog. They want a new toy. A new challenge. They are perpetually bored perpetual children. They feel empty inside.   I saw it said earlier: Where men have souls, women have lists.

1. That's Adrienne Clarkson for you. She's never had any issue with looting this country and spending as many tax dollars as possible.    She's actually the point where Canada went wrong, in terms of our Governor General. Before Clarkson, they were all ex-politicians who understood the gravity of their roles but then the government went retarded and decided that it would be a good idea to have a succession of diversity-hire, ex-journalists hold the highest position in the country.    She's ridiculous, she's never had any idea of what she's been doing apart from expensing as much money as possible, and establishing a ton of trophies and awards with her name on them.    The woman is a national disgrace, as she's been since her appointment.

1. I remember fearing the police as a teenager in the 90's. My friend drunkenly destroyed a wooden fence and was bundled in a police van, had the shit kicked out of him in the van for a few miles, and then thrown out the van.  There was only 1 women police officer i encountered back then and she was a big aggressive dike.  Male police officers also had to be a minimum of 5 foot 8 tall to apply.....   Forces around the country have relaxed their own minimum height rules since the 1990s.  A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said: "Over the years there have been many changes to the selection criteria used for police officers.  "There was once a minimum height requirement for male police officers of 5ft 8in tall, however it has been made illegal to discriminate against or reject applicants on the basis of their height.  I miss UK police being cunts. I feel like I live in another dimension now.

18. 																	This is just retarded. I'm sorry you can't understand the difference between being accurate and making up your own legality.  >It is allowing the government to use linguistic controls to define reality as they please, and subsequently punishing citizens for daring to express themselves outside the framework laid down by the state.  No, stop being dumb. The bill does nothing that wasn't already covered by harassment, instead it has categorized harassment in specific cases differently. There is no requirement to believe a word view because you can't use it's opposite to harass someone with without being fined.  > Just because the government says there are 32 genders and counting  Can you even source this?  >does not change the fact that human understanding, by and large, categorizes people based on widespread pattern recognition in a binary system.  This is why arguing in Reddit comments is terrible. This isn't what is happening. Consider the case of skin color. There are light and dark skin tones. This does not mean that there are no skin tones between the lightest and darkest, nor that there are different colors apart from tone. Additionally, people of certain tones recognize themselves as not being the correct skin tone and feel uncomfortable about it (e.g. albinism).  This false dichotomy that always pops up is stupid and wrong.

1.    NDP candidate Laura Kaminker, a self-described “Marxist” running in Mississauga Centre, said in a 2014 blog post she refuses to wear the “fake poppy” and described Remembrance Day as “war glorification.”  “I just wear my peace button on my jacket as always and wait for the collective brainwashing to blow over,” Kaminker wrote  She also criticized sports teams who honour our armed forces at games and she appears to be a 9/11 conspiracy theorist, suggesting there’s “no proof that bin Laden or Al Qaeda had anything to do with the attacks.”   All of you fixating on this one event, the whole world expected to stand in hushed silence because a bad thing happened to Americans,” she wrote while objecting to the commemoration of the attack.  Shamefully, NDP leader Andrea Horwath dismissed Kaminker’s repugnant views by saying “many people have many diverse opinions and we value free speech.”  Never vote NDP. Cocksuckers

6. 					I'm getting sick and fucking tired of middleman faggots dictating what I can and can't buy, what media I can consume, what opinions I can express, and every other fucking facet of my internet life. They're like a more-insufferable version of those Amazonian dick minnows that swim up your peckerhole and shoot barbs into your urethra. And as if that weren't bad enough the parasitic little cock-burrowers have the audacity to demand that they be able to peruse a menu and pick which dickhole they prefer to infest.    It's fucking ridiculous. I pay money to a content creator to fund his work, and the site leeches their cut off the top. That's how the game works, and I'm cool with that. Gotta pay if you want to play. But something's clearly and inherently broken when these modern day pharisees cut into their own profits to prevent a perfectly legal transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller.       These are the types of things that drive men to take drastic measures. There's a miasmatic aura of frustration and anger lurking just below the surface of polite day-to-day discourse in this country. (U.S. I won't speak for the rest of the west, though I suspect this is true elsewhere) The fact that the myriad bad actors on the left seem dead set on hacking through the last handful of threads holding our collective decency together is honestly highly concerning to me. I feel like we're a handful of bad actions away from crossing the line onto a one way street not one of us is going to enjoy very much.    Sorry about the wall of text. Sometimes I get on a roll and lose sense of when to shut the fuck up.

1. Feminists and trannies can't coexist for long. High school and college "girl's" sports are already having guys switch over. I couldn't make my high school basketball team but I'd have been an all star on the girls squad.   I still don't get the outrage about the whole trans movement. If you have a dick and want to wear a dress no one is stopping you. That type of shit happens in prison all the time. All the pronoun shit is a little retarded though

1. I've been playing with women and minorities since the 90's.  My favorite DM in Highschool, over 15 years ago, was Hispanic. Our games were usually 25-50% women players. Hell, even our local LARP group team was POC-led (The DM above) and featured a number of gay and female players.  This trend continued this after college and my table in the last 2 years has almost exclusively been women and gay men that are in love with the story telling. I welcomed them exactly the same as I have any other person that has sat at my table. I give them the same shot and let them live and die on whether or not they act like twats.  I've never had a problem with sexism or diversity in my games, and I'm in the midwest.   The only time I've ever had issue is when 2 local art college snobs that changed their genders and descriptors on a whim started a group we joined.   After a series of 'magical realm' issues, censorship on what we could say (Except the -enlightened- DM), inserting political/social rants pre- and post-game, and a round of 'Can we go around and announce our pronouns' followed by 'and now food allergies' I was done.    Those people were twats.      I especially loved the 'Genderfluid Queer Demi-whatever' DM that shouted down our active gay players, viewing it as a sort of oppression olympics. Also; 'Try not to be triggering, but here's my OC... a half-drow/half-orc rape baby who needs to murder her family'     Again, those people were twats.   And I stuck around for a year before taking our best players and becoming a forever DM.

BUT, you can't say that a guy who bastardized your plans and fucking ruined them is a complete cunt when you're in charge of making the next big movie that's part of a massively popular franchise and the both of you work under the same suit.

2. 	My favorite gaslight is "Stop being so demanding of people who spend their lives trying to entertain you."  They aren't trying to entertain us--they're trying to make money through a product, and if that is facilitated through the consumers enjoying themselves, then that's a happy coincidence.  I guarantee that none of the people at Blizzard would still be there if the company decided its employees were to be unpaid volunteers.  There's nothing wrong with wanting to make money with a superior product.  Everyone has to make a living.  But let's not pretend that these developers are making games because they want the players to be happy.

5. 			Current political climate? This is nothing new. Anyone who is LGBT but doesn’t dress like everyone else or talks about LGBT issues has always been told they’re “basing their identity on being gay” regardless of how many other interests they may have. It’s just a way to pressure people into conforming to the dominant culture so people don’t have to be reminded that LGBT people exist.   I could easily say you’re so devoid of interesting qualities you base your entire identify on historical strategy video games, judging by your profile.   Mainly posts in the subreddits, profile picture is the logo, your about me section is “the last roman”, your username etc.  But that’s obviously not true. Or maybe it is, I don’t know you.   But if my username was “gayboy2727”, had a profile picture of a rainbow, mainly posted in LGBT subs, then I’d be a “faggot” who obviously has no other interesting qualities to you.   And by the way, your post is just a rehashing or Chris Rock’s “there are black people and then there are niggers” skit, which he later took back because it was misguided and gave racists an excuse to bash anyone who didn’t act completely “white”

Intent is all that matters and she's not sorry what she did.  Traitors should be put in prison.  She's very open about her hostility towards government.  Fuck that cunt

1. Getting arrested at the age of 20 for carrying a bottle of alcohol , not even being inebriated in any significant way, and for not giving your information to a cop for such fucking petty shit.   Land of the free btw. And what a great use of police time and tax payer money. Gotta enforce those remnants of Victorian-era retarded cultural conceptions i guess, so important.

It's the acting like she's allowed to have it, walking away, refusing to obey lawful commands, assaulting a cop, spitting (assault) on multiple cops, acting like a bitch, claiming they can't do that, begging other bitches to assault the cops, and screaming for a a manager that makes this annoying to us.

5. 				The text logs are out there and easy to google for -- this was a long-term campaign of repeated harassment.  This dude would try to bring up some other normal topic of conversation and invariably the bitch would "WHEN ARE YOU GONNA DO IT?  QUIT STALLING!"  over and over again.  Yeah, I get it, tough guys on the internet are like "I would never kill myself because some twat told me to."  Good for them.  But this kid was vulnerable and was being constantly manipulated.  I've manipulated weak, vulnerable people into doing things they didn't want to do before.  It's not hard.  This chick just proves what a psychopath she is that she managed to berate someone into suicide.

1. >I have long grown tired of those conversations  So are we, but you cunts keep bringing it up. You're like children, Author.  >what always underlines the violence of “appropriation” in the first place: anti-Blackness.  Oh REALLY? So it's always anti-blackness (With a lower case b because unlike you I don't consider race a critical factor. Probably because **I** am not a racist.)  Cultural appropriation isn't a fucking thing. So it's not violence you regressive moron. And therefore it's not anti-black.  >Black people adopting other cultures or customs is not appropriation. Appropriation is about benefiting from other cultures while simultaneously dehumanizing them.  Oooh! So first you redefine racism in a vain attempt to absolve yourself of being a racist cunt, then you redefine 'cultural appropriation' in a vain attempt to defend yourself from it too.  Why you're at it, why don't you redefine the word "arsehole", Author, so that you can try to avoid everyone realising that's what you are?

3. 		No, sorry.  ​  It's actually an objectively piss-poor, utterly retarded take made by people trying to cast star wars as extremist religious idiots.  ​  There's so much...wrong with almost all of their assertions and none of it makes any god-damn sense. For one, the whole "You didn't like Jarjar, but you got over it." is actually and factually just total and utter bullshit. Episode one is so reviled that it even popped up in tons of pop culture.  ​  Here's what happened to the fandom: shitting on things via youtube became extremely popular post Redlettermedia. RLM basically took what was a poorly formed, not very good consensus of "I don't like Jarjar." and replaced it with a litany of very good criticisms that slammed Lucas for every single writing decision he's ever made in all of his movies. He carefully and expertly filleted everything about that movie, and he pointed out things that were shit that nobody(literally) had ever pointed out before in nerd circles. He managed to do this in a way that didn't really feel like some fat comic book guy screaming at the screen, mostly because he did it in a funny voice, had a character that was an easy-to-laugh-at caricature(an obese, old as fuck serial killer) and most of his shit was new content. It wasn't 70 minutes of screaming about Jarjar. A good example would be him pointing out having different stories going on muddles the emotional impact of the entire finale...which is true. Nobody had ever pointed that out(despite the fact that it's basically stated in the behind the scenes footage by the film's editor). George Lucas was *so mad* about the Mr. Plinkett reviews that he quit film-making all together. Literally. He didn't name names, but he did say "people on the internet" and it's a *very* fair assumption that the TPM review was a huge part of that. He can't take being told certain things and bailed the fuck out.  ​  Anyway, after Plinkett comes out and transforms the general understanding of criticizing something, instead of bitching about endings, instead of bitching about a specific  character, people now wish to ape and take off from RLM's success and start doing it as much as they possibly can. Since SW was sold, there was a big explosion of reviewer channels and there's a lot of people who go out of their way to 'clone' the Plinkett style. Sometimes they just try to be smart and come up with original reasons for Why Something Is Shit, and sometimes they literally use the name music and sound stings.   ​  Point is, Plinkett opened the doors for being pissed about something on the internet to be more viable than it has ever been. You can make some serious cash doing it and get a ton of followers.   Another issue was timing - and another issue is that when you're loudly and openly political, you can't be taken with a benefit of the doubt. Sure maybe Mace Windu existed because they wanted to have a black dude in the movie, but like, nobody every stated "That's right, black people can use the force, too!" Wearing "The Force Is Female" shirts makes a dude side-eye everything you're doing, because now it's not "oh, neat, a girl." It's, "Oh, I see, This is the Agenda at work." When you openly state you have an agenda, only the dumbest of fuckers will assume you're not aggressively pushing it with every statement.

4. 			Are you aware of what Social Media companies are doing at the moment? The thing that caused Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey to testify before Congress for doing?  They’re censoring people for wrongthink and all of them deplatormed Alex Jones recently. That’s why it’s bad.  And before you say you can go somewhere else, Silicon Valley will try to stop you by going to web hosting sites and fundraising sites because they don’t agree with your political beliefs.  Edit: Also Brietbart released a video of Google reacting to the 2016 election with them acting like their worldview was just shattered.

Letting telecom companies do this in no way helps to stop tech companies from doing it, and as has been pointed out, it only strengthens their case.  What you would rather do is diminish efforts to establish a free internet until you get what you want first out of spite.  You can fuck right off with that shit

2. 	>A private company's obligation is to shareholder value, not peoples feelings about themselves.  I used to believe that. (insert clip of Molymeme doing his standard *"corporations are legally required to avoid waste and maximize profit."* rant here) But when I saw Intel give $300 million to retarded feminists I just couldn't pretend anymore.   A private company's obligation is to the shareholder's *agenda*, but that doesn't necessarily mean value or profit. Spoiler: The shareholders are giant banks and their agenda is globalism.  >Only the CBC can get away with ignoring economics.  The whole financial system gets away with ignoring economics. Look at Twitter's numbers or our dudeweedstock bubble; global 'markets' are a debt-fueled farce. The cherry on top is millions of people wasting time and energy by solving meaningless math problems with rigs full of overpriced video cards because somehow that's going to "stahp teh central banksters."

1. Some translation is needed to get through all the shit she is spewing.  *Here it is:*  >At first I thought he was some sort of performance artist but then it became clear that he was not well  I thought he was fucking crazy, but that isn't PC to say so I'm going to play ignorant for the reporter.  >'He was screaming and shouting at me and saying things like 'I am going to f****** kick you' then he did actually kick me.  Yes I heard him say it, but I was in shock that he actually kicked me, ME! Doesn't he know who I think I am? I work in FASHION, and was only taking this train *ironically*.  >he was a big guy and I am only size eight.'  Even though this interview is about the attack, I can't pass up this opportunity to show off how skinny I am.  >The fashion CEO is keen to stress she does not blame this man, who she desribes [sic] as being 6ft tall and of Southeast Asian descent.  He was a mentally ill foreigner, this is the perfect time to virtue signal about how much I care about mental health and the plight of minorities!  >'I remain more angry with those white middle class men who left me to it  A woman can do everything a man can do, I just didn't want to get hurt that's all. Yes, it makes perfect sense ((points nose in the air)). It's actually all THEIR FAULT for not **manning up** and taking my punches for me. How dare they not worship the ground I walk on. It's misogyny I tell you, misogyny.  >'You are cowards with less empathy and strength than two size 8 women......  I get a two for one. I can both insult their masculinity AND brag about my dress size again. This is turning into such a wonderful day! That will teach those middle-class white male scum to show proper respect to a **high-class female** such as myself.

1.  I've never seen anything else people are so determined to hate. No good news about the game ever matters. It's all a scam. At this point not even the game itself releasing and god forbid, actually being good will convince any of you. It wearies me seeing all these "experts" saying "the game won't even come out, it's gunna fail this year lol." for 8. Fucking. Years. And Star Citizen is still here. Like a fungus you want to get rid of. But it ain't going.  "But it's taken too loooong"  Cry me a fucking river over by CD Projekt, who've taken 8 years and 3 restarts to get Cyberpunk to a frankly similar state Star Citizen is at.  What? You actually think that pre scripted video CDP put out reflected the actual state of the game? It's a mess of animations, script logic, half finished assets and T-poses. CDpro won't ever show that to you because it'd make them all look incompetant. No company other than CIG will. Because CIG are stupid enough to show the warts and all. People think Game development is so easy.  Now, I'm sure Cyberpunk will be a great game. But Game dev isn't all smart people making the best decisions and having the best outcomes. It's people. They make mistakes. The mistakes delay production, they fuck up because they have a vision that doesn't mesh with the stupid engine they chose requiring years of work to sort out. That ain't a scam. It's humans doing what they think is right for a project and being wrong.  Frankly, whether Star Citizen succeeds or fails is of no consequence to me as someone who only paid the bare minimum during the Kickstarter. I have my concerns but people need to chill out. If the game doesn't come out, or it does and it's not good, you can tip your fedoras, massage your neckbeards and sit smug in the knowledge that you were right on the internet yet again.   What actual benefit do any of you get from the game not coming out though?   ​

2. 	Seriously, that guy is a far greater misogynist than we are.  We, at least, think that if women are *adults*, they don't need to have adult matters explained and re-explained to them like some naive, innocent girl.  We propose that an adult woman, with voting rights, a driver's license, an education, and physical and mental maturity doesn't have to have the birds and the bees explained to her by the time she's hanging out with men.  If she doesn't know, why is she there?  And if she does know, why do we have to treat her like an autistic case, a retarded person, or a person suffering from dementia by assuming she doesn't understand *basic things* adults ought to know?  It takes a serious case of sexism to presume that a woman who has had multiple sex partners, knows how to flirt, goes on dates unchaperoned, and knows how to seduce has absolutely *no idea* what a man wants to do when she's alone with him in a private place.  Are women really *that stupid* that they can't even understand this?  And yet, this is what people like Dameron suggest when they say that women, out of their ignorance and inability to understand sexuality, can't ever be presumed to know what they are doing, and must be constantly reminded of what they are doing, to ensure they don't get hurt.

7. 						That's such a retarded answer. Alimony is completely standard in divorces. A man or a woman is not wrong to ask for alimony. It comes down to a compensation for division of roles in the marriage. Where one part, typically the woman, normally stays at home and tends to the house and children, the other part, typically the man, is the main breadwinner. These are all tasks that make up an adult person's life. It isn't wrong or weak to be the part that stays at home and tends to the house. It's just the division of roles in a traditional marriage. And if and when that marriage ends, the party that gave up a career to tend to the home and children requires compensation for the experience they lost on the job market, so that they are able to maintain the same standard of living. This is all standard and typically understood to be fair by any reasonably intelligent adult.

1. But the right wing subs are still being shut down. The only difference is there's no longer a hub subbreddit (BanOut) where people actively targeting right wing subs are congregated. At least not publicly. But the ends they seek still remain and are still being carried out. The subs BanOut targeted are still shut down. The accounts still banned. The comments still deleted.  BanOut:2018 is still very much active. Now it's just hidden. Be wary.   Edit: I go into further detail on this and connect some dots further down the thread.

11. 										Guy, you gotta stfu. You're not right. I'm using RAINN's definition because I'm not a fucking retard and this is the standard definition in the U.S. If you want to post your neo-feminist bullshit that all sexual assault is rape, I'd love to read it. Please, post what you *think* rape is considered. Show me the three other states that prove you right.    >What is sexual assault?   >The term sexual assault refers to sexual contact or behavior that occurs without explicit consent of the victim. Some forms of sexual assault include:  >Attempted rape  > * Fondling or unwanted sexual touching  > * Forcing a victim to perform sexual acts, such as oral sex or penetrating the perpetrator’s body  > * Penetration of the victim’s body, also known as rape  I'm not smug, I'm just not at the level of autism that you are. I state a fact, you call me "mentally ill", I show you proof, you say it's not the definition that you use (you're Dutch right?). Go fuck yourself back to europe you sack of shit.

4. 			Everything about the story is more or less believable but at the same time... it's just, it's basically *exactly* the story I want to hear.  Radfems getting reality checked when the outside world is different than their echo chamber gives me nourishment.  It makes me wake up with a hardon but it's so pure it gives me the motivation to go for a three mile run before breakfast.  So when I see a story about it happening without any proof or corroboration, I get suspicious.

3. 		I'm going to devils advocate against Crowder for a second:  I think that if you allowed for a rather generous definition of "Rape Culture", a rape culture _actually does exist_ on college campuses. Hear me out.   At least, up until the recent Title IX insanity, here's what's going to happen. Say you have been raped, assaulted, or otherwise have a credible accusation. You go to the school administration (your first mistake!) over this. What do they do?  Obviously, rape is really really bad and the school administration wants to prevent it, stop it, and bring consequences on the predator. But... there's other factors.  Maybe it turns out that the accused is from a very politically well-connected family, and if you pursue action against hi, his parents make trouble for you. Maybe his cousin is a major donor to the school, or he is a star student in sports or academics and has a really great reputation that the school gets to enjoy by proxy. Or maybe, maybe the school just wants to keep their risk of reputation damage to a minimum.  It doesn't really matter the specifics. The fact remains that _*the university's priority is to protect the university, not the students*_. The university is working with HR bureaucracy incentives: make the problem go away as cheaply and quickly as possible so we can get back to business as usual. Often times, and _especially_ in more ambiguous situations (everything from regret-sex to he-said-she-said situations), the easiest way to do that is to take the bare minimum token action so the victim feels like you did something, and then sweep it under the rug. No investigation that makes rumours spread, no spooky increase in rape stats for your campus, no potentially making powerful people mad. Just Make It Go Away.   If you're someone who is actually a victim, and you actually want justice, and you go to the administration, and this happens, you could be forgiven for believing that this is representative of a "rape culture". From your perspective it sure looks like _rape happened and they didn't care_. But in reality it's just a natural consequence of the fact that bureaucracies follow incentives and the university has some very strong incentives hanging over it, much stronger than one hysterical freshman.  But I would argue that it is absurd to call this a 'rape culture'. Even if the situation I've laid out means that it is literally true that there is a culture that covers up rape, it is still incorrect to call that a rape culture. Why? Because 'rape culture' has a connotation that this is about rape specifically, and that it's at least partially intentional. In fact, the situation is actually caused by a higher level, more general thing, for which the rape scenario is just one of many consequences. If anything, it's an "incentive culture" or a "cover-your-ass culture".  Of course, the fundamental cause of this whole scenario is a mistake on the part of the victim: Why the _*fuck*_ would you go to _university administration_ over a _crime_. The university administration is NOT fair and NOT neutral. They are in fact heavily biased in favour of "whatever costs them less time, money, and effort". They're NOT your friends. The university administration solves problems for _the university_ and sometimes the problem (to them) is the victim who won't drop the issue.   All of this, ALL OF IT, is trivially solved if people do what they're supposed to do and _*report crimes to the police*_.   For an analogy, imagine an HR department at work. Imagine you have a problem with someone at work. Doesn't matter what it is. Do you report them to HR?   What if the problem is that this other asshole is constantly muttering insults under his breath towards you. Oh, also, this asshole has been here for 15 years and singlehandedly saved the company from bankruptcy. And you started 3 weeks ago.   If you go to the HR department they're immediately going to think "oh, seriously? The veteran employee _saved our company_ and this dipshit who hasn't even been here for three years can't take a joke about it? We have to get the newbie to shut up before the veteran gets pissed and quits to take that job at Google we know he's been eyeing". They want _the situation_ to go away but that is not the same as solving your problem.  The absolute best case scenario for you going to HR is that HR brings in the senior guy and tells him to knock it off. And now he's mad. He knows that you narc'd him out to HR for the things he said and now he's pissed. Out of spite he'll give you terrible performance reviews and you'll never get promoted. He'll make even snarkier comments but always in a way that's plausibly deniable. By going to HR over this, the only thing you did was make your problem worse.  You could look at this situation and say "SEE, THIS COMPANY HAS A HARASSMENT CULTURE" but that's not true. Actually, this company has one guy who is kind of an asshole, that everybody kind of hates, but also the company realizes that there's some unpleasant realities about the world that can't be escaped.   If you're the victim in this situation, you could spent your whole life getting bitter over it and complain about how corporate america has a harassment culture. You could see your career stagnate as you spent too much time complaining and not enough time doing your job. You could turn into a pathetic shell of a human being. Or you could man up, take some simple and commonsense actions to stop the petty jokes (eg maybe avoid him in the hallway), and if the behaviour is sufficiently severe, go to the police over it.   TL;DR: Retarded 21-year-old children don't understand that bureaucracies will always work for their own best interest and label this "rape culture"

1. First comment from a LTL, but this one is triggering as hell.  Non-english speaker, so please excuse the following train wreck.  The sheer amount of arrogance and virtue signaling is strong enough to wake up the old ones from their endless sleep in the abyss. I just can't understand how one could decide to write a 6 paragraph long essay shitting on one of the most prolific authors in his genre, while thinking it would have any other results than making her look like an entitled brat.  ​  I mean, there is so much wrong with this garbage:  > H.P Lovecraft was a racist \[...\] so are his stories.   I would agree on that one, but I'm sensing the inability of Mrs Greer to distinguish between the actions/thoughts of the characters in the novels and the actual thoughts of Lovecraft.  I've read a great (great) amount of HP.L works, and some of his stories could definitly be interpreted as racist. Some of them are better than others. Some of them are just bad. It *doesn't* mean we have to throw away his work like a piece of trash, while praising the god of virtue for this sacrifice.  > what Lovecraft gave to the genre of cosmic horror was his hate   Well, I guess I'll just admit that as well, afterall, it's written on the internet so it must be true.  ​  > Which is now video games' problem.   Oh ... I thought it was harassment and misoginy. Now it's a matter of tentacles and white male heroes.  >For decades video games have been regurgitating the themes, plots and aesthetics of his stories with not one ounce of scrutiny.   Indeed, we live under a Lovecraftian patriarchy that's ruling over the video games' kingdom ...   \- *Silent hill maybe ?*    *- No! Examples and logic are the tools of the oppressors !*  >the troubled white male heroes that contain his arrogance and his gross simplification of mental illness are recreated in video games with no subversion, no critical thinking   Says the girl who's calling for a ban whithout having substantial knowledge of the subject.  But I guess next time I encounter a three headed shoggoth, I'll try not to run and overcome my will of simplification.  ​  > Here's the other thing. It's not just deeply problematic, it's boring.   This is *litterally* becoming a statement from the fun police.  *"This is NOT fun, you hear ?!"*  Thing is, I would agree that *seing* the same stuff over and over again could become quite boring in the end, but what's cool about the novels is that they are, you know ... novels. And immagination is a waaay more resourceful friend than any rendered monstrosity, when it comes to fear and despair.  ​  > It's time to let go of Lovecraft   Jawohl mein Kommandant.  > No more tentacled multi-eyed monstrosities, no foggy fishing towns or ancient aliens posing as gods.    There. Here it is. I'm almost certain she googled "Lovecraft novels", pulled the two tops results (I'd say A*t the moutain of madness* and *The Shadow over Innsmouth*), read the backpage ... aaaaand we're done. "Look at me, I'm an HPL expert now !". When people appeal to the most obvious tropes of a genre that's definitly richer and more complex, you know they're dumb as hell, or playing so to convey their message.  Sidenote: I should write a paper on that, denouncing the *litteral* rape of the reader when exposed to Lovecraft's work. I'm pretty sure I'd get published.  >Because let's remember, the things people say they love about Lovecraft's work? \[...\] they don't belong to him.    This is so fucking stupid. "Let's move on. Because let's remember, the things people say they love about Mozart's work? The violins? The sense of beauty and emotion? Guess what, they don't belong to him. NEEEXT !"  ​  The paragraph on Soma is the least retarded of all, although I would question her understanding of existentialism (I'm not sure to what she is refering to since it can have different meanings in my language).  Opposing SOMA to HPL is quite dumb though: both explore many of the same topics, but uses different ways of doing so.  It should also be noted that you can easily swap SOMA and HPL work in her critique to get an inverted results that still sound (it doesn't, but it looks like so), due to the lack of examples and actual work.  ​  > It's proof that not only can existential horror do without Lovecraft's dusty old tropes, it can flourish.   A yes, the goodol' "we can do without". Suit yourself, and bring me some non binary horror story that I can thrill with. For the time being, I'll dwell in my *hatred* driven world.  ​

1. AWALT - Tattoo's or not, it doesn't make a difference. AWALT applies, always and to every woman. Don't forget that..  I'm happy MGTOWS are showing to become more of a BS Incel shitshow.. So cause I have tattoos I also wouldn't be a man? Wouldn't be reliable, real or anything?   This is Incel talk, not MGTOW talk. You guys will see a tattoo'd guy and get all up in arms cause he must be a chad and therefore not worthy.. That's just retarded.  I'm up in tattoos and all of them have a deeper meaning, a reminder, a memory that I cherish and get to relive more often due to seeing those tattoos. One is a tribute, another is a declaration..   I don't really care what others think of it, but AWALT isn't necessarily MORE true cause a woman has a tattoo.. The women that don't have it are just smarter about pretending NAWALT.

2. 	Breast can be very sensitive. Underdeveloped milk ducts (before childbirth) can be hard and painful, and augmented breast are often  hurting from the implants. It's like the mans balls.   So grabbing boobs hard can hurt a lot. The reason why women at soccer protect them.  So no pussypass, he hurt her probably really bad. It's very frightening when a man hurts you during sex. What else will happen if he's not at all interested in your well-being? Will he hurt you more? Kill you even? How will you survive this? Will he get very angry if you try to talk about it, since he didn't listen before? Maybe he'll hit you or worse.  So, you go to the police to report the man who made you hurt and scared. It's what they're there for. An honest mistake is grabbing a boob once, hear that it's not ok and not do it again. Assault is doing it again. It's not hard to understand.   Glad your ex is your ex. Hurting someone's sex organs and whining that not letting you hurt their sex organs is unfair, is so unfair.

2. 	I've been saying this for a long time. Women don't get careers because they're interested in what they can create or produce, or what kind of meaningful work they can do. The workplace is no different than a dating game for them. It's all about sex. The way they manipulate their coworkers/supervisors, they way they use sex appeal and actual sex for promotions, and all to get high enough to lock down some dude they think they can extract resources from.   After they get that dude, they don't stay in their careers for very long. They'll either go work someplace else, or quit working entirely.   Or if they don't get the man they sought out for, they become the miserable cunt we all have worked with who hates everybody and everything, who refuses to go a fraction of a millimeter outside the absolute bare minimum for anything or anyone, and then they go home to a bunch of cats and complain about the patriarchy in feminism forums.

1. I thought it was utter garbage, borderline at the levels of the abomination that was the latest Berserk adaptation, except at least that had [good music](  Then again, I only watched the first episode and skimmed through the next two. But again, everything I saw was awful. The dialogue was insanely shit, stuff like woman in ep1 talking about "sciences" as if they even had a concept for something like that or like that word was supposed to make sense to the people fucking up her place (or her just failing to understand their perspective at all, since presumably she's so fucking retarded she literally doesn't know a single thing about the society she lives in), or Dracula's retarded *everything* he had to say, or Alucard's dumb-as-fuck soliloquy about how he's the mirror image of Dracula or whatever cringy shit he was saying before I skipped past it, the main character 'bantering' with his dumb companion sounding like the interactions between two characters in an episode of deviantart's sonic porn (or even worse, honestly; at least that shit gets into So Bad It's Good-territory, Castlevania was just bad and dull), the VAs were shit, the animation dull and unengaging as fuck, and I don't know about the music but I assume it was shit too.

2. 	I dunno, I work with a networking organization for women, so there are frequently only women at the meetings. In that case, you'd generally say something like, "Alright, ladies, let's get down to business," instead of "Alright, guys, let's get down to business."  That being said, I don't think the second version sounds entirely wrong. It's just that "guys" is **often** used to refer to either a group of men or a mixed-gender group; I don't really see people address a group entirely of women as "guys" too often.

1. The TL;DR is that it's some retarded e-celeb bullshit that has little to do with GG.  Sargon and Metokur have been taking passive aggressive shots at each other for a while, and things came to a head a few weeks ago.  Ralph's Killstream is new home of Internet Bloodsports since the rest of that scene imploded.  After two weeks of refusing to go on Ralph's stream, Sargon messaged Ralph claiming he had some big plan to run by him.  This resulted in a [trainwreck of a stream]( where he suggested some harebrained scheme to get Trump to endorse GG.  Seriously.

1. This seems to a bit of an idiotic topic but there is some merit it in perhaps... though  I have seen anime that does the opposite. I'm not talking about like pointless abuse. Honestly in a lot of anime, they abuse the concept of smacking a guy around because he is a dense fucker and can't knock before entering a bathroom.  This annoys me a bit too but it isn't a monolith. Take Maken-Ki ecchi as fuck anime. That happens to the main dude, he literally forgets because he rooms with a few chicks. Now it's possible to forget, but in a small defense of them. If you forget 24/7 that's being fucking inconsiderate. Secondly this guy does intentionally peep on chicks sometimes, so it's hard for him to claim innocence because sometimes he really *isn't* innocent.  As much as I found inuyasha to be garbage for this, and other reasons, it made a lot more sense in Ranma 1/2. Ranma *went out of his way* to poke at his, somewhat betrothed's, insecurities. Sure people should get over their insecurities but when someone has insecurities about not being feminine enough maybe when you have to live with them you shouldn't tell them like 8 times a day they suck at being a chick. Ranma was a dick to both Akane and other people at least half the time.  Now, on the flip side you have recent shows like konosuba and Aho Girl.  Kazuma right out states he's having none of this bullshit. he will also smack a bitch if he thinks she's being an idiot, not that ti works with darkness cause she's a kinky masochist and gets turned on by that, even when he acts disgusted at her behavior in public and means it. He will routinely tell aqua she is useless and a bitch in public- because she is.  In Aho girl main dude is possibly a bit of a dick but he has lived around the main sex obsessed bitch for his entire life, her precocious ass would routinely do things to him in their childhood that he didn't want to do that might well border on sexual assault, he was too physically weak to stop her. This lead him into gaining more strength, probably mostly just happened because puberty. He now due to her current actions and past actions *knocks the fuck* out of this chick, who is in fact so fucking stupid she routinely gets zeros on all of her tests **all of them**. His aggressive, pretty much assault and battery, treatment of this chick scares everyone around him especially the other chicks, but he just has no more patience for this chick who is selfish, stupid as fuck,inconsiderate, and a **MEGA THOT** obsessed with his dick.  So both extremes exist and largely played for comedy. The chicks doing it to dudes is more common but let's see western media even as a joke try to do some of the dudes not putting up with chicks bullshit. It wouldn't fly- Japan doesn't seem to give a fuck maybe because they don't seem to be as psychotic over there and realize that shit ain't real.

2. 	Konosuba is an interesting case because everyone in the world except for maybe Vanir is completely fucking useless as an existence, since the whole LN is comedic at its core with a slight slice of romance. For every instance of Kazuma going full Al Bundy on one of his retarded team mates, you also have Kazuma getting killed, eaten, imprisoned, or actually having to fess up to his own bullshit.  It's a world with equality.  Also, the girls actually have redeeming qualities (except for Aqua) and stand by Kazuma when it counts, even if they have severe reservations because it's Kazuma, because he puts up with all the rest of their shit.

1. I have no comment on any of the articles written about the presentation, because I didn't read them. I formed my opinion by reading the presentation itself. I disagree with this video's assessment that the presentation isn't as bad as it's made out to be.  The premises in the presentation are that censorship by the platform owner [is acceptable]( provided the rules and effects are clear, is  [politically neutral, and focused on tone]( They see the platform owners as "[hospitality organizers]( I reject these premises. For one, I don't see google/twitter/facebook any more a "hospitality organizer" than I see my email provider: they provide a service by which I may communicate with others. The standards I use to communicate with friends are vastly different than those I use for business contacts, and I neither expect nor desire those standards to be enforced by the email provider.  Secondly, these providers [already see themselves as politically neutral]( and focused on tone, so following those guidelines just gives us more of the same. And of course tone itself isn't politically neutral: see the censoring of the legal term ["illegal aliens"]( (though to their credit they appear to have backed off on that decision). Or the infamous "gender pronouns" debate. If I call a M2F transgender person "he", is that "tone" (and subject to censorship), "political" (and not subject to censorship), or a giant grey area subject to the whims of the censor and how they feel about me and/or the subject on any given day?  Thirdly, being transparent about why you'e censoring someone doesn't really help the person being censored that much. We know exactly why The Daily Stormer was deplatformed: the GoDaddy CEO woke up one day and said "I hate these guys and want them off my site". When Alex Jones was deplatformed there were news articles and official statements on standby to tell us why it happened. When has such transparency ever answered more questions than it raised? You're still trying to polish the turd that is highly subjective standards with the shine of "policy" and "procedure".  Fourthly, what if I don't want these platforms to "police tone"? So far they have a shit track record in policing their platforms; why should I trust them in the future? Earlier the presentation poses the question "by what right do you do this?". They try to answer it by saying "well we'll only focus on tone", but the question remains: "by what right are you the arbiter of 'tone'?"  Fifthly, if there is a problem with "tone", why enforce a top-down, one size fits all approach to it? Why not empower the users with more advanced tools to filter things themselves (or for others with their consent) without removing the "offensive" material from the platform. Filter lists and moderated feeds could be services provided by users, for users and under the total control (including the ability to modify filter lists, opt-in/out of them, and ultimately disable all filtering/moderation) of the end-user. That way people can tailor their experience to suit their own sensibilities rather than having one standard thrust onto everyone.  Finally, I love the use of "family friendly" terms. When Germany censors things it's to ["make online spaces safer"]( but when "dictatorial leaders" want to do so it's to ["improve their methods of control"]( And on the [page]( where they discuss flagging porn (which has regulations around providing access to children) and malware (which has quantifiable harmful effects) they provide a case study of The Daily Stormer (who was engaged in legal if unpopular speech) being taken off the internet, thereby trying to create a (strained) association between the three.

2. 	>The premises in the presentation are that censorship by the platform owner is acceptable provided the rules and effects are clear, is politically neutral, and focused on tone,   Some moderation exists on every virtual platform that I'm aware of. The point that Insights is making is that you have to identify what your moderation is going to be and effectively communicate it without taking a political bias as a platform. That's entirely reasonable.   >They see the platform owners as "hospitality organizers".   That's just a quote giving context to their primary point, which is: "People are asking how to behave on your platform, rather than solely how not to". This means that they are saying that users want to understand what is *supposed* to be their standard of conduct, rather than just what *isn't* their standard of conduct.  >For one, I don't see google/twitter/facebook any more a "hospitality organizer" than I see my email provider: they provide a service by which I may communicate with others. The standards I use to communicate with friends are vastly different than those I use for business contacts, and I neither expect nor desire those standards to be enforced by the email provider.  These are wildly different things in both a digital and legal sense. Your emails are *private* communications. You literally have (under American law) an expectation of privacy which *even the police* are not allowed to violate without proper judicial and legal grounds. Public comments on a public platform to engage in a public conversation are going to be totally different and have completely different moderation. I'm not even convinced it would be *legal* for Goggle to moderate your email.  >Secondly, these providers already see themselves as politically neutral and focused on tone, so following those guidelines just gives us more of the same. And of course tone itself isn't politically neutral: see the censoring of the legal term "illegal aliens" (though to their credit they appear to have backed off on that decision).  The report specifically tells them to be politically neutral as part of being more consistent with their rules because tech companies *haven't been*. Google's failure to learn isn't a problem with the report.  >Thirdly, being transparent about why you'e censoring someone doesn't really help the person being censored that much. We know exactly why The Daily Stormer was deplatformed: the GoDaddy CEO woke up one day and said "I hate these guys and want them off my site".   Transparency helps when the rules are consistent. That's the point. You have to do both, that's why both are recommended. What happened with GoDaddy is an inconsistency of the application of rules, not a lack of transparency. If GoDaddy were to be consistent and transparent, they should have a rule that states: "GoDaddy reserves the right to remove your domain, without notice, at any time, because the CEO doesn't like you."  >Fourthly, what if I don't want these platforms to "police tone"?   Tone policing exists in a social context, whether you like it or not. It's why you can't just run up to someone and start screaming "FAGGOT!!!!" in their face, and why American law would probably allow them to hit you to get away from them. *Some* boundary exists for tone. The point that Insights is making is that you should be policing tone *and not content*. SCOTUS does the same thing with the first amendment. It's why the government is not allowed to engage in "viewpoint discrimination", but is allowed to arrest you for disorderly conduct if you won't stop screaming.  >Fifthly, if there is a problem with "tone", why enforce a top-down, one size fits all approach to it?  They actually say that users will have shifting desires and demands, and a one-size-all approach doesn't fit.  Is fifthly a word?...  >When Germany censors things it's to "make online spaces safer", but when "dictatorial leaders" want to do so it's to "improve their methods of control".   One is the justification of the German government (which you see everywhere in lots of governments), and the other is just a quote from Soros.  >And on the page where they discuss flagging porn (which has regulations around providing access to children) and malware (which has quantifiable harmful effects) they provide a case study of The Daily Stormer (who was engaged in legal if unpopular speech) being taken off the internet, thereby trying to create a (strained) association between the three.  The page is about "active curation". Everything in it is active curation: good, bad, or ugly.

3. 		> Some moderation exists on every virtual platform that I'm aware of.  Moderation doesn't require that content be removed. Slashdot for example, despite having moderation, never removed any comments. It just hid them from default view, but you could always browse at -1 if you really wanted to see the GNAA or goatse comments (along with a handful of well-written comments expressing unpopular views).  > That's just a quote giving context to their primary point, which is: "People are asking how to behave on your platform, rather than solely how not to".  I disagree that this is something that should be the responsibility of the people who run the platform. The platform administrators should concern itself with things that destabilize the platform, and provide tools so the users themselves can control the content they see.  > These are wildly different things in both a digital and legal sense. Your emails are private communications. You literally have (under American law) an expectation of privacy which even the police are not allowed to violate without proper judicial and legal grounds.  Usenet is perhaps a better example because it is a public forum that employs a similar model of moderation to email. The ISP Usenet servers oftentimes filtered spam and the binary groups, but the posts themselves weren't removed from the system; so you could usually pay for access to servers that didn't filter. And while some groups were moderated, others weren't; and the moderated groups maintained their own rules. If you preferred to read the unmoderated groups, a client-side killfile provided crude means for user-controlled filtering.  Usenet's technical considerations aside, I think modern platforms would get less push-back if they adopted/improved upon that approach to moderation: the platform just serves you the messages, lets you post, and provides tools for users and groups to moderate as they see fit without global posting guidelines. If something is actually illegal (in the "forward to the FBI upon removal" sense), or a court orders its removal, then the admins can pull it.  > The report specifically tells them to be politically neutral as part of being more consistent with their rules because tech companies haven't been. Google's failure to learn isn't a problem with the report.  Perhaps not, but it may suggest that being politically neutral is one of those things that sounds easy but in practice is really hard or impossible.  > Tone policing exists in a social context, whether you like it or not. It's why you can't just run up to someone and start screaming "FAGGOT!!!!" in their face, and why American law would probably allow them to hit you to get away from them.  True, but I might be able to run up to a friend and do that without being hit. Are tech platforms able to make that sort of distinction? So far they haven't done so, either because they don't want to, because it's a hard problem for the AI systems they're using, or because the content being flagged is being reviewed by someone who doesn't understand the context well enough to make the distinction.  > They actually say that users will have shifting desires and demands, and a one-size-all approach doesn't fit.  They say that [in context of changing their rules over time]( I didn't see anything in reference to suggesting allowing have control over moderation.

1. Even if libs have a job they expect to be paid a "living wage" for whatever dime a dozen job they do, like this guy I know who is 35 and works at a No Frills. "If you can't pay a living wage you shouldn't exist as a company". It makes my head explode. If you want to be paid more money, do something that most other people can't do. Ronaldo gets paid an assload of money because very few people play soccer as well as he does. Steamfitters and welders get paid a lot because very few people have the combination of physical strength and mental fortitude required. Any moron can work at a grocery store after a day or two of training.

4. 			don't do it man, some cunts did this to me (well, in reality the dude who owned the moving truck hired guys off the side of the road who in turn did this to me) and stole two bags from me and my wife, one of em had my passport my birtth certificate my marriage cert, deed to my house, everything in it, all my important documents. The other bag had some random things but included some intimates of my wife.      Since it was a foreign passport etc.  stealing it is a huge deal so we talked to the truck guy and said look we just want the documents and everything back, get them back or we go to the police and stealing a passport is absolutely no joke.     We got the documents back  ​

1. My thought on this is that the sexes experience objectification in different ways. Women generally seem to be more susceptible to and take more harm from sexualization than men, however this "news" page is extremely condescending towards both Kit and the fact that men ARE ALSO affected by sexualization, even if not as much or in the same way as women generally are.   It's like the bullshit about "reverse racism" and how there is no such thing as racism against white people, because racism is a social construct, etc. which is also why men can't be sexualized. It's a retarded, usually leftist (I'm a socialist in Sweden, meaning more of a leftie myself), blame game protected by hurling out racist, mansplaining, you-name-it type accusations just to keep someone with a slightly different opinion, quiet and make them feel overly privileged and ashamed.   Just because you've been beaten up four times, and I "only" once, doesn't mean me getting beaten up is a non-existent problem and I should only care about yours. The problem still exist and will have to be addressed in the same manner independently of which gender I was born with.

For me to say 'thief' and for him to take a game, it made me feel like it was a sexist remark. He's never taken a game from a man because they said 'thief'.  No cunt, you ARE the sexist.  You have equal rights.  You have the right to respect others if you chose to.  If you dont, then dont attribute consequences to your alleged gender (which to be honest is so pumped up with testosterone YOU have been unfair game for most other women in the sport).

I can not agree with it. I do understand that amount of fraud from users that think they are anonymous behind VPN would grow up exponentially, but honestly, I still can no tagree with it.   later edit:  my reason for this is that banning an *algorithm* (or a technology) due to fraudulent use of said technology is retarded. Its same as if they'd ban knives because knives could hurt people in hands of bad people, and having knives enables bad people to use them to hurt people. Adding additional verification steps in case if a user is behind VPN is OK and would be a "totally legitimate and not shady" business practice. Violating user's privacy by not allowing VPN is not.

Maybe there would be more serious repercussions if she was a politicians or worked for one who removed signs from an opposing candidate but that's not really the case here. Still a cunt move though.

1. Ok so this is really weird   The entire thing about the norwegian flag = Nazi flag thing originates from Germany and east Europe from *after* WW2 as a way for skinheads to get around the 'no Nazi imagery' law a lot of those countries have.   Thing is, it's a *very* European thing. Even to someone living in Norway, it's not normally a thing a ton of people know. I only know about this because of the time my German friend had a party with a few family members from Germany and had a birthday cake which, in the grand norwegian tradition, had a shitton of norwegain flags on it (which raised *a lot* of eyebrows from the Germans there).   So why is this weird?   Because to know the second meaning of the norwegian flag, you need to be either A) from certain parts of Europe or B) be familiar enough with German laws and skinheads to know about how they get around the "don't wave around a fucking swastika you cunt" law. And in either situation it would be bizzare that this person would not know *that it's also the fucking norwegian flag* as in A) I would hope someone in Europe would at least vaugely remember the vexiology of their own continent and in B) the use of that flag makes absolutely no sense without any context regarding Norway and Vikings and all that    Also that's less of a halfway house and more of a "nearly completely rehabilitated and just waiting for the jury to say I'm good" house.

6. 					The proof was when it was found out that Serena is exempted to use certain drugs and supplements that other players aren't allowed to use.   Under the guise of therapy.   It's a loophole to cheat.  WADA records were hacked to get this information.    The UFC had similar exemptions to allow to testosterone therapy.   You should see how a couple of those fighters looked.   It's cheating.    She plays tennis.  It's all cardio.   I find it impossible that she looks like a body builder.   She really must spend all her time lifting like a power lifter and her spare time just eating.     edit;     has much more detailed information on her career and all the PED incidents that she has been a part of.  Very difficult to think she is a clean athlete.    Serena then doubled down on her exemptions to claim that drug testing her is also racist.

Hola compa, and Hi Indie friend, we as Mexican and Indians share a lot of "values" you could say.  * Family oriented * Sense of humor * Poverty origins XD  We Mexican are a bastard culture, so the idea of men running of of marriage (cum and run) are more common than not marrying at all, so not sure how MGTOW will affect us.  ​  Good work policies tho

12. 										> It’s not a privilege to be coddled. I’ve seen feminists use the term “female privilege” plenty of times. You can search the term in any social media (if you can sift through all the antifeminist comments and posts bashing all of feminism because women have these few “benefits” from patriarchy)  It's comical that you pretend like feminism has no problem acknowledging female privilege, even as you refuse to use the term yourself and feel the need to put even the word "benefits" in scare quotes. Hell, go on a half dozen feminist communities and start a conversation about "female privilege". Let me know how positive your reception is. Odds are you'll be derisively called an "MRA" and shown the door.  > “Presumption of joint custody OR sole custody” isn’t that what men want?  I haven't seen too many men arguing for a presumption of sole custody. Presumption of joint/equal custody, however, is something many father's rights groups do fight for, and the NOW fights *against* this, often with arguments about how joint custody is merely a tool that men use to abuse their former spouses.  > Pointing out the fact that women are more likely to be victims is not denying that men can be victims. God forbid this organization focus on the majority of people who need help.  Katherine Spillar openly said she considers "domestic violence" to be a clean-up word for "wife-beating". In interview with Cassie Jaye, she openly said "it's not women beating up men, it's men beating up women". She's not alone in this. The state government of victoria pushes this in [mandatory school programs]( I guess those aren't "real feminists", though.  > Abortion is not the same as having a child and then deciding you don’t want anything to do with it with no repercussions. A fetus is not the same as a child. Autonomy is not the same as avoiding a bill for 18 years.  Most formulations of legal parental surrender involve surrendering your rights and responsibilities *before* childbirth. Feminists seem to flip their shit at that idea, as well. That said, single mothers do have the right to [have a child and then decide they don't want anything to do with it with no repercussions](  > And feminists reaction to it  That's a nice attempt to deflect from the fact that an influential feminist organisation (Women's March) promoted Donna Hylton as a speaker on the mistreatment of women by the legal system. Hell, even the thread you linked can't agree that this was morally wrong, only that it was a tactical mistake.  >   Did you even read your source? It says right there that Odeh was convicted of the bombing, and bomb-making materials were found in her home. The only counterpoint is that Odeh herself insists she was innocent. I'm somehow not convinced.  > So how do you “erase” an advantage without taking something away from a group? Wouldn’t you have to raise the lower group up in order to level things out?  By making policies that forbid treating people differently on the basis of their immutable characteristics.  > Could you give an example of what you mean   For example- almost every western country has an equal pay act that makes it a crime to pay someone less on the basis of their sex, race, etc.

Never been called an MRA for talking about equality on a feminist page   > NOW fights against this, often with arguments about how joint custody is merely a tool that men use to abuse their former spouses.  They fight against the loopholes that people can use when they’re abusive so they can’t use their children as a way to keep abusing a partner (which actually does happen 😱) focusing on certain circumstances doesn’t mean they don’t want any normal fathers to be in their children’s lives    > Katherine Spillar openly said she considers "domestic violence" to be a clean-up word for "wife-beating". In interview with Cassie Jaye, she openly said "it's not women beating up men, it's men beating up women".   She’s saying what she sees. The people seeking help are almost always women, and so she made her own commentary about it. I personally wouldn’t say domestic violence just means men beating women, it obviously goes both ways. But I guess since me and her have different opinions that means feminism is bullshit. Meh 🤷🏻‍♀️   > Most formulations of legal parental surrender involve surrendering your rights and responsibilities before childbirth. Feminists seem to flip their shit at that idea, as well.   Some do. I think if the father makes it clear that he won’t take responsibility before 12 weeks then it should be okay.   >That said, single mothers do have the right to have a child and then decide they don't want anything to do with it with no repercussions.  Do you mean abortion or adoption..?    > Did you even read your source? It says right there that Odeh was convicted of the bombing, and bomb-making materials were found in her home. The only counterpoint is that Odeh herself insists she was innocent. I'm somehow not convinced.  Did you read it? It says she was physically and sexually tortured into giving a confession.   I’m not diving into the back story of every woman associated with feminism in all of history. I simply believe in equality and feminists are the people who are the most vocal about intersectional injustices. But I guess because some lady may have bombed a place in another country that makes feminism void lol

1. ‘Involving politics isn’t why people got mad’  That’s EXACTLY why people got mad. GOG’s social media account used a popular hashtag that had strong political tension rather flippantly. It wasn’t the most tactful PR, it wasn’t exactly ‘co-opting’ either, but either way it was a landmine of a hot topic.  If twats are going to dox them over such stupid nonsense, of course GOG will shy away from it entirely. Arguably this withdrawal action to avoid future politics isn’t a ‘dogwhistle to Gamergaters’ *because they aren’t the ones getting angry and threatening GOG’s team.*

3. 		>However he had managed to maintain a culture of meritocracy for 25 years, capably and without peer, before this happened. That should not be ignored when discussing him.  I will always give someone their due. Torvalds created something absolutely fantastic. I'd never question his tech skill (I'm in no position to), he created something useful to so many, and he deserves tons of praise for that. No one's going to take that away.  The problem I have is that Torvalds was such a cunt for so long, and this was accepted, because what mattered were results. People were expected to check their feelings, get a thick skin, and have a higher priority than being upset at a criticism or a telling-off. Now it turns out that Torvalds was willing to be a cunt only as long as he wasn't upsetting the right people, and that the importance of the project wasn't really paramount at all. It was just that, until now, no one else (no group, no political affiliation) was sufficiently important to restrain himself regarding.  The project (and everyone else's collective work - including the people who soldiered on despite having been cunted off to) wasn't important enough to hold the line against this absolute shit-show of a CoC, so why should he continue to be revered? Grinding his nose in the CoC he himself greenlighted seems like proper payment.

"yes dont let people be held accountable for their behaviour its unfair for people to see the face of someone who physically assaults others"   Perhaps if some pencil dick retard didnt protect M'laday's honour when she pulls this shit in future there will be clear evidence based on her conduct and character which will help any future victim be believed.  but thankfully this mangina masked her face so when she plays poor damsel in distress against someone without video footage they cant use this instance against her and will get screwed.  slow clap bravo, bravo.

4. 			I’m not saying at all that she shouldn’t be held accountable for her actions, but if her face were revealed for what could’ve been a momentary lapse in judgement it would have been completely excessive compared to what she did. Especially since it’s possibly illegal for him to do that. In certain states it’s illegal to release footage to public of people without permission. That’s why the YouTuber always asks the people he’s driving if he can post the video or if they’d like their face blurred. So before you go on thinking that men who forgive people are “pencil dicks” and “manginas” how about you think of the times when you were a fucking moron and we’re thankful that people spared you a little fucking slack because you were completely in the wrong. This video blew up and it’s likely the woman saw it. I’d say it’s pretty reasonable to assume she realized how big of a cunt she was being and I’ll bet she tried to be a little less cunty in the future. But from these two comments you posted it seems that you’re still pretty cunty in the present. So hopefully you fuck off until you realize how moronic you’re being.

5. 				This may come as a shock to a cunt like you, but i dont go around assaulting people in public so there is no footage and would be no footage of me doing such a thing, likewise i dont go around defrauding people and if i did i would have no grounds to complain if i was named and shamed for the world to see.  is there anything you actually do get right?

6. 					I believe in second chances and if the bitch in the video does something like that again than she fully deserves the public shame because it’s likely she’ll end up as a fluff piece on her local news. But until then I think she gets the right to privacy. Legally and morally. I’ve fucked up a few times in my life and I’m thankful I was given the time to realize i was in the wrong and learn from the shit. Why would I, or anybody else whos been given a second chance think differently?

Murdering people over time is better than all at once. It's called optics.   Ignore all that. It's white people. Ya hey Don, in a country majority white people, it should be majority whites committing crime and shock how its actually a small 13% causing fifty percent of them.  Fucking retard but that's why cnn employs him and that's why low iq tune in, same brain wave.  Don's saying be concern about a demographic causing low crime. That's racism. Pointing out blacks cause the most statistically is a fact but it gets labeled as racist. Can't win with all this race hand holding.

Thank the guy, let him know that its his turn and either leave or kick her out (if its at your place).   Speaking of that, I've never truly understand why dudes be trying to fight other dudes whose smashing their girls. They're basically whiteknighting her cheating. 😂

1. The worst about this whole thing is that Sargon openly admits (and has been repeating all over youtube) that the purpose of his so called "Gamergate 2.0" is to "trigger the libs" and cause drama, and it doesn't have any kind of ethical or ideological foundation.  So now the a-GG media can point at Sargon's retarded comments and say "see? this proves gamergate has nothing to do with ethics, it was about triggering the libs all along!"  We have to disavow Sargon in the most firm and clear way, and I propose having a "unsubscribe from Sargon" day and hit him where it really hurts.

1. sometimes I just cant express how much I just don't care what these vapid dottering twats are complaining about.  ​  I don't care if you feel underrepresented.  ​  I don't care if you want big name companies to pander to you.  ​  and most importantly I don't care about your cause that you are fighting for. in your over privileged first world country life style.  ​  while people in Africa are starving. and people in the middle east are being killed indiscriminately by dictators, while there is even any kid anywhere having to go to bed with an empty stomach.  ​  I cant say it enough. I just don't care about these irrelevant problems or how hurt your feelings are.

1. Women like this piss me off. I’ve seen two videos where a woman went off on a construction worker for not whistling or cat calling a woman but for saying “hello”. She was even going all crazy in the vid saying “YOU DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY HELLO TO ME!” And I just saw one where a woman was being stalked by a man. She saw him in a building next to hers and then he came into her building. He was a mailman...

1. My husband is friends with at least 2 cosplayers who have had run ins with her and can confirm she is a disgusting beast.  One of them had her breasts exposed by this bitch while posing for a photo. Fat cunt came up behind her and pulled her top up, then laughed when she shrieked and ducked to cover herself. She just waved it off as a bit of fun when cosplayer ripped into her for it. The other had stories, confirmed by her also cosplaying husband, of the disgusting cow grabbing her ass, boobs and trying to grope her groin. She also tried to cop a feel on the husband and he managed to turn away, but seriously wanted to punch her face in for touching his wife. They reported her to security instead.  Husband is going to Blizzcon again this year and thanks to the two cosplayers + husband/bf he knows going, and sharing a apartment with him to help save on expenses, a few others that are also cosplayers and friends of the first two will also be sharing the space. He's already made the rule that if they wanna have some fun, drinks and games they can invite a friend but NO MoMo under any circumstances. If her or any of her posey try to show up they will get a door in the face.

1. Absolutely retarded. Most students are in class for about an hour at a time. In my high school there was one bathroom that almost no one used because it was so far from the other classrooms that no one who used it would have time to get to class. In college a girl in the dorm behind mine gave birth over night in the bathroom and threw the baby out in the dumpster. It was only found because a few mattresses were discarded and needed to be removed by hand.

2. 	I find it funny that this stuff is getting crapped on so heavily. Every time there's a thread that involves more traditional "magic", the comment section is filled with people talking about how OP got it all wrong and they know because they're Wiccans and practice spellcasting themselves. But apparently the belief in Emoji magic is way sillier than that.  Guess what... any sort of belief in magic is completely retarded. If you're an adult who believes in spellcasting, you're an idiot.

1. I have very mixed feelings about this because on one hand ISIS is horrible and needs to be erased but on the other do we really want a system where they punish the family members because of what their husband or father did?    Like would it have been appropriate to kill all of the German SS's wives because of their involvement in the holocaust?

5. 				You obviously have not read the other comments.  Here is a hint: ISIS was notorious for sex trafficking and forced marriages.  I guess you don't know that.

I don't see 40 women crammed into that cage all getting one hearing.  I see one bitch and she's saying she thought she married a rapper. Another claimed she thought she was moving to Turkey and only later realized it was actually Iraq. Ooops. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯  Sounds like their individual cases have been heard.

1. [Oh, is that right?](  [Alternatively]( The whole "Lovecraft was racist" bullshit is the perfect example as to why these people are all ideologically-driven thought supremacists. Because H.P. was a great example of a man that, even if we were to analyze him on the standards of his own time, took great steps into bettering himself and respecting others, throughout his life. An abused shut-in, that feared everyone and everything outside of his own study, that was able to let go of his prejudices bit by bit, and without ever being an incident (recorded) of him actually denegrating or insulting someone for being of another race. BUT THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH!  If these whiny faggots had any marbles left, they'd at least try to co-opt Lovecraft, claim that his work was self-criticism of the man's own biases (which they were), and how people can be reformed if someone reaches out and offers to be a helping hand. But no, fuck that shit! Wrongthinkers, past, present or future, need to be slandered, harassed, tortured physically and psychologically, and led to kill themselves so that the moral busybodies can then morally-grandstand on top of their graves.

Until they look in the mirror they should not be given power. The CPC smells just like the Democrats after they chose Hillary (rigged against Bernier, rigged against Bernie).

3. 		I mean... Back in my day kids did that by skateboarding and listening to punk rock, or by pretending to worship the devil... I'm not sure where this gender identity bullshit came from. I honestly thought the stuff we make fun of on here was confined to the late teens/early 20s sjw type and that it was blown out of proportion most of the time. Didn't think this stuff is now common place in highschools.  The difference is that when a kid decided they were goth 15 years ago, everyone knew it was just a dumb phase except for the goth kid. This gender identity crap is a fad disguised as progress, and the kids are getting outside feedback reinforcing that behavior and putting that idea into their heads that they're woke and discovering who they really are... nobody did that for punk/goth kids, because everyone knew it was retarded. And I mean... I'm sure it's helping some kids who are real-deal queer, but overall this shit seems like it has a potential to cause a ton of damage, unlike the fads previous generations had going for them.

10. 									Sure.  When someone your side disagrees with doesn't say anything racist, you accuse them of using secret "dog whistles" to prove how racist they are. And if that means fifteen thousand shit-flinging gibbons retweeting an accusation that a Mexican-American Jewish descendant of Holocaust survivors is a white supremacist, well, that's just how loose you're willing to play with your accusations. It's secret Nazis everywhere with you people.  Meanwhile, when people on your own side, like Sarah Jeong, make explicit, repeated calls for genocide you excuse it as "obvious jokes."  This is why I tell you to eat shit. You're not interested in applying anything like a consistent standard; it's all just a pretext for a bunch of assholes to try to expand their own power and influence. You don't give a damn about racism; you just want to use it as a weapon against your enemies while defining it in such a way that it can't be turned against you when you engage in blatant racial discrimination, stereotyping, prejudice, and policies meant to disadvantage specific groups on the basis of their race.

11. 										Couple things. I barely know who the fuck Sarah Jeong is, and it’s almost entirely because this sub wouldn’t and apparently still won’t shut the fuck up about her. Putting me on the same “side” as her means nothing to me, again I don’t know who she is. When she quits her job and forms the people’s army of Jeongists and starts murdering white people, then I’ll take y’alls screeching about her more seriously.  Second there **are** a lot of secret nazis just as there are some not so secret nazis like Richard Spencer.   Real fuckin bold of you to downplay the anti-semitism in this country not even 3 days after a mass murder in a synagogue.  Lastly I do care about racism. I’m lucky enough to live somewhere diverse enough where I don’t see it every day. But I know that my non-white friends don’t necessarily have that same experience.   If you really believe that all men were created equal how do you square that with disproportionate murders by cops and incarceration?

You hypocritical fuck.  > Real fuckin bold of you to downplay the anti-semitism in this country not even 3 days after a mass murder in a synagogue.  Because one person is anti-Semitic does not mean everyone you disagree with is anti-Semitic. I am an unapologetic Zionist, and I catch no end of flak from leftist shitbags for it.  > Lastly I do care about racism.  Except when it's against a race you don't care about, and then it's just "obvious jokes." Hypocrite.  > If you really believe that all men were created equal how do you square that with disproportionate murders by cops and incarceration?  [Black suspects are not more likely to be shot by police than white suspects.](  This argument is fucking stupid, though. You could see a far greater disparity between urban and rural crime rates than in crime rates between races, does that somehow imply that the police are discriminating against city dwellers? Or does it just mean that people in cities are committing more crimes per capita than people in rural areas?  This idea that a disparity in outcomes implies prejudice is childish and stupid. Crime is complicated. A lot of things affect crime rates, and incarceration rates once arrested have a lot to do with what kind of lawyer you can or can't afford. Black people are more likely to get public defenders, and public defenders are shitty. Black people are more likely to be given harsher sentences on the basis of recidivism risk, because [black criminals are more likely to reoffend,]( with most of the difference coming from past criminal history.  Once you develop mental sophistication beyond that of a young and particularly stupid child, you'll figure out that differences in outcomes don't *have* to come from prejudice, that *other factors exist too.*

13. 												And why can’t blacks afford good lawyers, why do blacks generally have less wealth? Could it perhaps be because for generations they labored for free? Almost as if the problems with race are systemic in America and require structural, sweeping reforms to address.   You’re still downplaying antisemitism. “Oh okay we have ONE recent hate crime and antisemitism is back.” Ask the Anti Defamation League about it, antisemitism is demonstrably on the rise in America.  Oh and its funny that you conflate supporting Israel with supporting Jews worldwide.

Hell, he disliked Jews and married one. I’m quite sure, if he were alive and we met, he’d dislike me from first sight.   But does that mean you throw everything he added to a genre out?

1. The process for me started with the general snarky tones of games journalists on podcasts. I heard one whine about a co-host using the word crazy and I found it absurd. I also didn't like the dismissive and self centered way they were speaking about the next (current console generation) going all digital as if people who couldn't afford/don't have access to high speed internet were Luddites holding society back. It was very San Francisco elitist.   When ME3 occurred I was more on the side of journalists. And I even today I still day expecting Bioaware to change the ending is fully on retarded and no chimping out is going to convince me that outrage mobs should force artists to change their production. Get angry and warn others all you want but demanding a change? It happened, get over it and don't buy the next Bioware game.  But out of that incident were reports of people getting on the case of one of the writers and I don't think people should have harassed her but iirc she was sort of flippant and snarky, but all the outlets white knighted cause wamen and that didn't sit well with me.   I wasn't at gamergate ground zero so when I heard of it, I immediately dismissed it as a bunch of spergs crying because some game was in 59 fps instead of 60 fps or other such typical gamer nonsense. However by that time I was tired of gaming press becoming more and more adversarial and making more and more petty, disingenuous complaints so I decided to give GG an earnest look. Additionally I started seeing comic pros act u professional and normie fans were applauding while clutching at their pearls because you could see Ms. Marvel's thighs.  I also didn't like the way I was see more and more judging history based on the oh so enlightened ideals of today.  Some time around this time during a State of the Union President Obama (whom I was a fan of at the time) mentioned the wage gap which didn't sit right. I assumed he wasn't mistaken but I couldn't see how it was legal. And if it's illegal how are these very public companies very publicly getting away with it?   From that I saw some Youtube vids of people I wasn't normally interested in, including  a 2 hour binge of TL;DR on a road trip.  And now I'm a black Alt-right rapist white supremacist puppeteer of world politics.   To PATRIARCHY!!

8. 							It is interesting to see you consider us "mentally fucked" but you're unable to formulate a simple response without the utilization of phrasing that you expect to be offensive.   So let me address your points.  >You PPD people are so terrified of women that you have to devote an entire sub to watching them get the shit beat out of them to feel like men.  The point of PDD isn't that people get beat to shit. It's about appreciating the rare circumstances where there is actual equality at play. That does include violence, which I do not condone, but also things like custody going to the father because the mother isn't capable, and the "woman card" doesn't work.  In the end, all we desire is an equal, fair and balanced treatment for anyone. We simply applaud those days where that happens, in this sub.  > A leader would laugh and would be over it instantly.   A leader would be able to read the room, adjust accordingly and handle the situation in a way which seems the best possible way. Did he get up too quickly? Absolutely. But it was a management meeting amongst equals, so his "figure of authority" was irrelevant.  A true leader would handle the situation in such a way that it doesn't escalate and follows up with appropriate measures. But you missed that piece of context, didn't you?

11. 										Thank you for the photography advice I do appreciate it. I'm not angry though I do enjoy fucking with people. I generally fuck with people that I think deserve to be fucked with. Yes there are some normal people that are entertained by PPD myself included at times, but you have to admit there are men going their own way and The Donald types here as well because they enjoy watching women get brutalized. They absolutely deserve to be fucked with at every turn. Piss off off with the vegan shit, I don't go around preaching. It took me many many years to successfully make the switch to plant-based, it was not easy. I do think it would be great if everybody did it but that is something people have to decide on their own.

12. 											Yeah...was just fucking with you about the vegan shit...low hanging fruit n all.  It is fun to fuck with people but there are all sorts in this sub...sometimes the womanphobics get loud...fuck em though their bloodline has a limited time on this earth.    Hopefully the photography advice comes in handy. My 50mm is my go to lens.  If I need to shoot farther away I step up to my 110mm macro but that was a pretty penny more.

Concern trolling      > the way you have been treating me is toxic. no other MRA has ever talked to me like this.      More shaming with specious claims - you called me a rapist, I suggested it seemed that you were raised in a home without a father.   Based on the evidence it is you who are toxic.      Based on your toxicity and your claims it appears you are doing what in psychology is called "projection".      > no other MRA has ever talked to me like this.      Unless you are a staggeringly precocious 4 year old I seriously doubt this.  Going through life playing the perpetual victim is not going to leave you happy.  Not that I particularly care about your happiness, I just don't want you poisoning *my* community.      > you are a toxic man.      More shaming.      > MRA is important for the future of our country and you personally aught to be nicer when talking about it because the way you talk makes it very easy for people to just cast you off as a mean person and assume all MRAs are like you.      Bwahahahahahaha - based on **YOUR** posts to other communities it is very, very unlikely you are genuinely concerned about MRAs or men's rights in general.      > I happen to know different. some people won't.      You know **what** different?  After calling me a rapist (like, an actual rapist, not some watered down "looked at a woman wrong" 'male gaze rapist').      What the actual fuck makes you think **your** opinion about me makes one whit of difference to me, or to this community?  I don't give a damn (play on user name) about your opinion.  Just exposing you for the troll you have proven yourself to be.

1. She ran for the NDP in my ridding in the last provincial election as well. Came by my house door knocking well I was out working on the tomato garden. Talked to her for a few min, seemed nice enough and undeterred by my large Doug Ford and local candidate sign in my yard.   Didn't really get the sense that she was all that politically astute though, and more or less her campaign was focused on her being the first openly trans-woman to run to be an MPP.   She came in a decently close 2nd, in a ridding that has been Liberal since the 50's. Think if the NDP had put up a candidate that spoke french they would have been able to win here.   Either way she put in some hard work, I don't think school trustees really do much, and to be honest from what I've seen of them, most of them aren't the most centered people either. We'll have to wait and see what, if anything, she does.   More than likely she'll go to a few meetings, make a few speeches that will be listened to by a few douzen people and she'll cash in her 15,000$/year paycheque.

6. 					Thanks. Fortunately, there are millions of others who think the same as I do - but the good news is that in a couple of generations we'll all be gone and you can come onto the future equivalent of reddit and note that life was better when the LGBTQ2 crowd were the oddest thing in the news instead of 'mentally ill' people getting surgery to transform themselves into inanimate objects that are fed soylent green through tubes.   Meanwhile, it's still a wonderfully free country and I get to share my views without kowtowing to the pc views of the day.

11. 										I'm sorry your daddy loved your bum a little too much but that's no excuse to be the hateful ignorant twat you are.  I suggest you get a job, move out of your daddy's basement and start acting like a decent human being, you might even make a non-imaginary friend or two if you can just stop being such an awful hateful person when you open your mouth and make speech noises at normal people!

Because [there's a lot of stuff *technically* under their incredibly broad remit]( and all it takes is a couple ideologues to fuck everything up.  Because "deliver effective and ***appropriate*** education programs to its pupils" means they can cut shit out of the curriculum if they find it "inappropriate".

1. /r/india, a leftist shithole that shits on India and has a Pakistani moderator. Where discussing negative things about Muslims/Pakistan/minorities will get you banned and anything negative about majority (Hindus) is upvoted to the top. I think they actually take sick pride in shitting on their country and people, 24/7, while anything positive is turned into negative or just never discussed (no discussion at all).  It pretty much contains everything wrong you all saw happening during GG, before GG was a thing.  It's called "Randia" for a reason and it's responsible for opening the eyes of many Indians (so in a way, I should thank them for being a bunch of SJW cunts).

1. I don’t see this as PPD material, really. Granted, she didn’t get her way, but she got to do what she wanted to do—sit in his car, delay his night, piss the guy off—and in the end, he has no repercussion because he’s on camera calling her a cunt. Funny as that was, Uber isn’t going to back him on that one...  My play would have been simple, and funnier for me in the end: ask them to get out, and when they don’t, drive in the complete opposite direction of where they wanna go.  “Oh, you want out now?

3. 		What is privilege? The left argue that whites have an advantage, right? Let's say a white kid has a 3.9 GPA and a black kid has a 3.6 GPA. Who gets into a college first? The black kid. Now let's say two people, one black & one white, with only a GED apply for a job. Who gets that job? The black person 100% of the time. Why? Because of black privilege through affirmative action laws. Clearly they have an advantage over white people. Now its become a regular occurrence to spew vile racism towards whites, and not allowing white people to even say "its okay to be white." Classic oppression. The left is trying, and succeeding, in gaslighting the world on who really has privilege and who is doing the oppressing.

13. 			INB4 "ur an SJW cuck" or w/e just actually read my argument and tell me that I'm wrong if you can put a hole in it.  If you wanna be empirical then present your argument with facts but everything you're saying here is pulled straight out of your ass and is just fake anecdotal evidence. [Here]( is some very clear, undeniable statistical evidence of white privilege in the United States. It's not just some meaningless term made up by people with a specific agenda, it's the reality of race in the US.   White Privilege doesn't mean "because you're white you will never experience hardship" or "because you're white, you are always at an advantage over every black person." It refers to the *measurable* effects of clear structural injustice that puts the population of people who are white in the United States AS A WHOLE ahead of everyone else. If you don't see that as a problem then you are a white supremacist.  On top of all of that, your entire comment is irrelevant to the original post (which by the way I agree with). I don't think that anyone deserves to have hatred directed at them for their race, gender, sexuality, religion -- whatever. That's totally something I can get behind. But your argument about privilege is irrelevant and facile.  ​

15. 					ah yes, the classic "point out the misuse of a word instead of considering the argument" tactic.  yes. i believe it is an issue that black people are structurally discriminated against in the United States. if you disagree with that, you are a white supremacist. there aren't two ways about that one. nice oversimplification and diversion tho.  also i didn't insult him?? i insulted his argument which, frankly, deserves to be insulted because it's *stupid.*  could you consider for a second, just to humor me, that white supremacy might be bigger than just a niche group of white people who believe they are a part of the master race? could it possibly be something that is so pervasive and normalized in our society that we don't even notice it all the time? something that is force fed to us through our education system, our media consumption, our families, and every single other agent of socialization to the point where it could be internalized even by people of color? doesn't the evidence in that hyperlink (which i'm starting to doubt you clicked) support that idea?

16. 						Your opinion on what white supremacists are is seriously fucked up.   There is no line of reasoning I can put forth to help you understand why huge blanket generalities in this manner are insane. You would refuse to hear it.  You've just tried to defend calling millions, potentially billions, of innocent people of *all races* white supremacists. Holy shit.

17. 							you have yet to put forth even one valid line of reasoning about anything at all in this entire conversation. if you were to say something that was a) not pedantic b) not predicated on (likely intentional) misinterpretation c) based on facts or at least well constructed theory -- I would be willing to give it the full attention of a valid argument. unfortunately that is not the case.  my argument is, one more time, in the simplest terms i can possibly put it:  1. black people are structurally discriminated against. this is statistically proven to be true. to be excruciatingly clear, this is *undeniable fact*. did you read the article? 2. it is a bad thing that black people are structurally discriminated against. 3. if you do not think it is a bad thing that black people are structurally discriminated against, *you are a white supremacist.*  go jerk off on your mtg cards or something dude i am very much done with this argument

18. 								I'll deny that fact just for the sake of denying it.   Claiming something is an *undeniable fact* doesn't actually make it so.     I love that you went through my post history to find a specific way to insult me personally. Even better is how sad the attempt really was...  This is an *undeniable fact.*  Nothing you say will change the actual definition of a white supremacist. You're simply wrong. This term does not mean what you think it means.This one really is an *undeniable fact.*  And yes I read your article. It's interesting and I get the point he made but it's not the same as yours. His sources are also pretty hit or miss, not really something I'd try to lay as the cornerstone of an arguement. This is an *undeniable fact.*    What you are talking about is systemic racism, not white supremacists. Labeling all people who disagree with you as a hate group is at best intellectually dishonest and at worst utterly retarded.

I guess they see popular games as an easy way to virtual signal how woke they are to their blue check mark followers.

2. 	I mean, I love when that's brought up. For one, he is a private citizen. Two, the emails are available on wikileaks - nothing improper. Three, I always ask "If an actual campaign member went on Russian soil, met Russian diplomats for the sole purpose of gaining opposition research - it'd be collusion with a foreign government to influence the election, right?  And then that's when I remind them that Hillary and the DNC did this with Ukraine.  Somemone posted a Vox article (lol) of the "evidence". At least they admitted it was not hard evidence. But it was:   1) Manafort - but they dind't say it was while working with Hillary's campaign manager's brother in Ukraine way before he ever joined the campaign    2) Cohen - but they didn't mention that he, like Manafort, was indicted on charges completely unrelated to Russia  (tax evasion)    3) Their last piece of evidence of Trump / Russia collussion was Trump, a businessman, considering erecting a tower in Moscow lol (he has them all over the world, even in Baku)    When this is your evidence....you'd have to be clinically retarded or so full of bias to not realize Trump/Russia is nothing but a conspiracy.  It's the second time I've offered such a deal. The last time, the other person was supposed to donate to a charity, but didn't. Typical lol  Usually these things devolve into Straw man arguments and deviate so far away from Trump/Russia. It gets into those Russians who created political facebook memes, Russians alleged "hack" of the DNC server.  They're so brainwashed that they don't understand anymore what facts or evidence actually means. They just think because Don Lemon said some edgy stuff that it must be true

9. 	With all the research we have on the psychological effects of verbal and physical abuse, and your answer is "well why don't they just punch them?"  You're so fucking ignorant, I'm bewildered that you had vocabulary to put together a complete thought. It's insulting to all victims of domestic violence.  I mean, don't most women have access to cars? Aren't cars bigger and stronger than men? Why don't they just run them over? Men can't even do any damage to cars, they aren't even a threat.   You see how fucking stupid that sounds? That's you right now. Looking like a moron.  Stop eating crayons.

12. 										I actually smoke Pall Malls! Blue 100s.   No, I’m not a virgin. I probably banged your mom (or *your* grandmother depending on how young you are) back in the 90s. I’m in a hotel in Seattle with my wife right now. It’s 5am here but it’s 8am at home. We took a long weekend away from the kiddos to see this little town. It’s quaint. Legal weed, too. That’s fun. It’s been a while for me since I tried that stuff.

1. In the state of California an engagement ring is a promise! Not an unconditional gift. By law it has to be given back unless its after marriage. What a fucking entitled slut cunt!  "In California we turn to a law dating back to 1939 which specifically addresses engagement rings and other gifts in contemplation of marriage--Civil Code section 1590; it states: Where either party to a contemplated marriage in this State makes a gift of money or property to the other on the basis or assumption that the marriage will take place, in the event that the donee refuses to enter into the marriage as contemplated or that it is given up by mutual consent, the donor may recover such gift or such part of its value as may, under all of the circumstances of the case, be found by a court or jury to be just. In this case the "donor" is the person (i.e., the man) giving the engagement ring, and the "donee" is the person (i.e., the woman) receiving it. A gift in contemplation of marriage can be revoked, unlike other gifts. Thus, California law is very clear on what happens to the ring - if the woman calls off the wedding, it goes back to the man. Also, if both parties agree that the wedding is off then the man gets the ring back. This California law has wide ranging impact for property given in contemplation of marriage. In an important case on the subject - Shaw v. Shaw (1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 159, a man and woman lived together for four years. He placed her name on real property because he relied on her promise that she would marry him when her divorce was final. The couple separated before marrying and the woman eventually married another. The court awarded all property back to the man because she failed to marry him. This has an impact on our society today because of the number of couples living together before marriage."

Cops routinely have to put up with every leftist retard getting in their faces trying to stop them doing there jobs. If that happens enough times then sooner or later the cops are gonna make an example out of a thoroughly deserving individual. The silly bitch in question turned out to be the deserving individual. >  > Even then she got off lightly. If I - a man - had deliberately and wilfully impeded cops in the performance of their lawful duties, I would expect to be either capsicum sprayed until I went blind or tasered until my balls exploded.

1. Again - no amount of telling those people how retarded they are will make them see themselves for what they are or change their minds.  My only satisfaction in all this comes from knowing that I don't have to try and make them miserable - they manage it all on their own. Thinking that probably makes me  bad person, and I'm strangely at peace with it.

2. 	Was this the one where he was so livid he flat out broke his "no swearing" rule? Granted even when he doesn't he is selective. Quote using the term "cum dumpster" would be more offense than fuck or shit to most people.  Also you can be REALLY viciously uncivil without a single swear word.  The man tore Zaid a new much more ethical asshole though.  Honestly for all his twitter shit(cause this is "current year" where twitter bullshit can get you fired) especially because some of it seems to be related to the case in which you aren't really suppose to antagonize people and show your extreme ideological bias of basically acting like waid's fuck buddy. Also isn't calling someone else's ethics or credentials into account when you know theyb are legit kind of unethical? Not to mention the fucking *FLAT OUT EASILY PROVABLE LYING(probably of his and certainly from waid in a written legal account)!!*  Seems like enough for Rekieta to suggest to the bar that this guy is unethical. Or do you both have to be in the same state?  Regardless of what Rackets does, I hope him trying chicanery lying bullshit before the court gets his weasel ass disbarred. The guy is CLEARLY fucking unethical as well as a shitty human being. At this point I wonder if he's just Waid's clone.  >Waid/Zaid claim Waid did not know Antarctic Press was located in Texas. Waid stated he knew the owners when he Tweeted he was calling them and called a Texas phone number.  The fuck kind of defense would that be? Like "yeah I know I broke the law but I didn't know it was Texas so I'm okay" at best that seems that it should mean he is tried in California but maybe that's the point that he wants soy filled judges not a proper american one.  I'm heard tell the judge that would do this case is a retired marine. Trying to libel/slander and fuck with another former marine's livelihood is liable to piss the judge off personally.

2. 	"She should get punished"  "Putting her in jail helps nobody"  tf you suggest she be punished then?  She has accused three innocent men of a despicable crime and almost ruined them completely and could've got them 20-life in a maximum security prison.   She deserves all 32 years if she'll even get them. This girl is pure heartless and is begging for sympathy at the cost of innocent lives. She's an evil bitch who deserves the inside of a cell to show that false rape claims are NOT OK

1. That's what you get for believing feminist bullshit.  Even here in the US, feminists try to pretend that women are "under represented" in government.....despite the fact women vote more than men.....which means they are the ones more often voting for men over women. Of course feminists have an answer for this.....which just so happens to be the same answer every single time a woman disagrees with them.....those women all have "internalized misogyny"......which is feminist for "those women don't count".

3. 		It's weird, though. Trump did help a rapist stay out of prison by pressuring the NYPD to put a bunch of random blacks and a puerto rican kid in prison for decades.  The rapist raped like a dozen women after the Central Park rape, and bashed one's brains out.  Trump was also accused of raping a 13 year old girl.  Why *would* white women vote for Trump?

1. Great wording for the topic. Better join a white supremacist group, go to Charlottesville, and shout "JEWS WILL NOT REPLACE US!!!" AMIRITE?! ! !  ---  There exists a very legitimate discussion and critique of immigration policies in many western countries, and the mistakes some governments are making.   It would've been fucking great if neo-nazis, white supremacists, and their ardent sympathizer and apologist didn't taint this whole argument such that it's becoming impossible to talk about immigration without being associated with these racist dumbasses. Good job fellas, stay classy.

5. 				true - but it all depends on what kind of person you are.  Sure, a good ol' kuncle sammich would be well deserved and justified after trying to kick him in the balls - but then he has to deal with the repercussions whether they be from his higher ups or from society, not to mention himself.    I was a bouncer for years and had this sort of thing arise on a near monthly basis - and I could never bring myself to dish out a nap to some dumb twat, even if they were essentially begging for it.  It would really take me being in some sort of danger to make myself to straight up punch a woman (or tiny dude) in the face.   I usually just sort of kept them away from me or grabbed wrists while blowing up the radio for some backup.  More often than not there was a cop standing right near us or within shouting distance up the street that would be there immediately - and I always felt like if I sort of hammed it up like "please, miss, you have to go, please!", it would make them look worse in the eyes of the cop.

5. 				There's an exchange that you don't fathom so you don't equate self-sacrifice as also beneficial but when men commit acts of self-sacrifice they access or fulfill a series of drives and needs that help them achieve self-fulfillment.  By adhering to our innate intincts men create the absolute best odds of quicky living to their fullest potential and I'm not going to cripple my son, retard his path, or deny him accessibility because you had a thought for him to walk a harder, longer, and more difficult path that provides the worst chances of success to gain something he'd achieve quicker by ignoring your advice and following his own instincts.  Feminism made demands of women and those that didn't compromise their instincts with their feminism write boring articles about the lack of fulfillment they're experiencing in their advanced age despite their fantastic professional careers and you want that for men?

1. The feminist movement has it’s clutch on Latin American society so strong it’s sad. I was watching a video the other day where a news anchor was questioning a teenage Argentinian girl if she even knew what an abortion was, to which she never answered btw, but it seems that they’re following this movement blindly only because it seems to be the “trend”. My parents, being of Spaniard-Colombian descent have never witnessed such decline in Latin American culture. These countries are all losing their culture as a result of following these insane ideologies.

12. 											Well firstly I'm flattered you have spent the time to look through my profile history, you must consider me pretty important. But "Petty insults"? I'm talking about the fact you can't even make sense typing a sentence, I'm definitely not dyslexic but I wouldn't sink low enough to make fun of someone if they were. For your information I do speak 3 languages, I don't think someone receiving Reddit gold makes their point any more credible, and I'm not a racist like you are either. The other funny thing is I probably share more ancestry with the American settlers than you do.   I think you need a better understanding of how Reddit works seeing as upvoted and gold seem to mean so much to you. You need to know where 99% of users fall in to on the social political scale. You can get upvoted for saying literally anything if it's in the right sub, the expression is "preaching to the choir".  And "cornered" me? I haven't even engaged in a debate with you because you're not worth my time. I think you're most likely a little teenage boy who doesn't understand the world yet. I gave you a true account of what I witnessed in Argentina and your comeback was some racist shot about being English and that you have family there who have lived there longer. You failed to address one point I made. As much as I love that country, it's a very fucking dangerous place to be, especially if you're a woman, if you were capable of attracting a girlfriend and have her live there you'd maybe see things from a different perspective.

No, okay.  no, it's anecdotal eye test evidence just like yours was  my point is that it's all up to your viewers. which is why I had replied, "why do you think women streamers should be wealthy?" because there's no "right" to wealth when streaming, it's donation based. I've never seen people so whiny and entitled to getting donations for playing video games.   "If you ain't got it, you ain't got it. The theory is brilliant"  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ lol

2. 	As I have been saying to people for most of this mess, being a bigot of any stripe is not the ultimate evil. Being a racist or some such is just a specialized breed of asshole. Sure it isn't nice and you don't really want to be around the person that much but most of them are just twats, they are either smart enough or professional enough to not let it bleed into their work, and they don't do this imaginary attacks. They just stew in their anger, often in private. They don't harm people just because they dislike or even hate them.  Hate crimes are bullshit. The reason is because hating someone shouldn't logically be illegal- harming them directly should be and most of these people- and I don't think nearly as many exist as these hysterical idiots claim do, won't ever get to the point they do that.

1. Some guy on youtube named Noncompete argues that all of video games failures are the result of Capitalism, that Capitalism itself only has two methods of increasing profits, that DLC, DRM, Microtransactions, Streaming, poor treatment of workers and anti piracy are all measures in one of those two ways, argues that marxism and unions are the only solution to making games and or gaming better and ends with a gamedrop.  ​  ​  The video includes many many many many strawmen arguments  ​  ​  Time to burn some strawpuppets  This will be faster if I just comment on the idiocy and ignore the constant strawmanning every two seconds  0:24 Bitcoin mining did not take up every card under the sun it was maybe 5 specific cards at most, no one was hoarding 750ti's in 2015 which you can still play gta V on  0:33 up until just before the bubble burst mining could easily offset the electricity costs  0:52 are you arguing that someone that openly pirates nintendo games wouldn't have cracked their copy of gta V?  1:33 there is more than one place to get roms  there is a lot of idiocy in this video, way to much to be normal, figured I would take this time while they rattle of strawman after strawman to write this part since there have been only 4 actual points in the 5 minutes of the video so far  4:59 Are they actually trying to argue piracy is a marxist issue?  5:40 "there are only two ways to increase profits" That is not true in the slightest, there are many many ways to increase profits that not include charging more or cutting costs, you act like consumers are a static non fluctuating number that you can only ever access a maximum sales number from. you argue as if there are only ever 100,000 gamers and that the only way to get more or less money is either cut your costs or rip off that 100 thousand its an amazingly limited viewpoint on how marketing works  6:53 The reason for telltale games failure was it failed to change, every game was identical because they were lazy not because capitalism forced them to do it, there are many franchises that barely change and profit year after year, telltales terrible writing, lack of gameplay are what caused to to go under  6:57 no videogames would do far worse if everyone owned their own labor and had workplace democracy because it ends up like trying to herd cats, everyone wants to do their own thing and push their own ideas leading to nothing ever getting done or worse feature creep, this is why there are team leads and company directors because when these people left a lone none of them could build a straight line without getting into an argument which direction it should face. (funnily enough you are literally arguing for a system like gamergate)  PS. horse you are a retard  7:20 You argue dead cells as if the company isn't founded on capitalism, the reason it can work as an "idea sharing" is because it has 11 people in it, telltale had 275 employees and you want them to all go their own direction? you also ignore companies like tale of tales that couldn't even function with 3 people, you disingenuously jump from comparing large scale productions to a team of 10, saying the failings are purely because those 300 people didn't have that same idea structure while ignoring the 100 or so other factors that lead to success or downfall  7:45 Steam =/= The companies on its platform, you instantly group everything on steam as capitalist when you don't know the composition of any of the studios on there, you cant sit there and argue Dead cells is a working example or Marxism but look at all this shit on steam its Capitalist scum conveniently ignoring Dead cells is on steam that is some amazing cognitive dissonance, since for all you know the Day Z guys could have been using the same team setup and Dead Cells  8:29 Gamergate wasn't about Anita, at least get one fact straight in the entire video  9:08 "So one company made once concession" This is literally the argument you are making to support marxism, that this one company succeeding using a system you like is what should tip the scales against all the other failures using that system  Now we end on more strawmen points

1. This is what human trash looks like and unfortunately there's so much more of it than these two. :( It's a shame people nowadays are growing into these arrogant halfwits who think they can bully others into doing whatever they want and have no respect at least for those who try to politely reason with them. I feel like this wasn't the case two or three decades ago.

2. 	It's not really mockery. They had a reputation for being obnoxious just like today. One retarded suffragette, Emily Davison, tried to run in front of a derby presumably to bring attention to her cause and was trampled by a horse and killed. The jockey, Herbert Jones, was thrown from the horse and suffered significant injuries, including a concussion.    That's how psycho these women were. They were willing to put the lives of others at risk for the sake of their stupid stunts and today, for some reason, they are thought of as heroes when in reality they were scumbags, just like today, and used their female privilege as a shield to whitewash their own disgusting and disgraceful behavior.

5. 				"Niggers should die", written a man -- hmmm, I'm wondering if that user you're responding to would have such a charitable reaction?    Remember here that we want GENDER EQUALITY, right?  That means women get not only the goodies but also the responsibilities.   Why is that so difficult to understand?    We already know why.  A study cited by Karen Straughan revealed that *both* men and women perceive equal treatment of women as not only sexist but "hostile", and preferential treatment of women as "equal."    Well, shit.   We're gonna have a hard time...

1. Skyrim has loads, you just didn’t take the time to get to know them.  Assassins creed has even more, but again you just assumed they were straight because you’re homophobic.  Hello neighbor even has gay characters.  The Witcher has gays, that one about vampires, hitman, loads of games have gay characters. You’re just a cunt who doesn’t play games trying to push an agenda in an area which you’re not a part of because you were told by other people also not part of the community that it’s a bad place and needs to cater to your whims. It does already, but you don’t know, because you’d rather stay ignorant and have a villain to fight.

1. Good post. Deserves to be "hot" so lets upvote. It's always good to get information right from the horse's mouth. This is yet another example of "alpha fucks, beta bucks" in action, and this one basically admits we men should be grateful to get them after they've spent their 20's having sex with over 100 men. No thanks, guys. You know the drill.  The more you guys wake up other (unaware) blue pills, the less these women will get validation and the quicker we can get that nice collapse of western civilization we all want as men basically "quit" participating in the system, thus bankrupting it and the social programs these women rely on. ;)

The fact that GG is indirectly correlated to the Kavanaugh scandal now is only going to make things crazier.  Maybe it will wake normies up though.

10. 									His campaign people called me the other day on my way home from work. They kept nicely correcting me when I called him Beta and I wasted about 45 mins of their day trying to see how stupid of a question I had to ask before they gave up.      Questions like "what is Beta's stance on expanding the current gender model to be more inclusive?" (Whatever the fuck that means) and "What is beta's stance on the terf/trans split? Is he pro or anti feminine penis?". They gave non-answers for these, but they didn't give up. I asked if he supports legalizing weed, then asked about heroin. Then crystal meth. They jumped on the first one, not so much the other two. And on and on the questions went.      Finally I pull up to my house and tell them I have to hang up, they ask if Beta can count on my vote and I inform them that I'm a Nazi and disagree with virtually all of the faggotry he stands for.      Anyone who's curious about why most native Texans can't stand Austin and most of it's inhabitants should just take a good look at Beta O'rourke. He perfectly encapsulates the smug, insufferable douchiness that's infested that once-beautiful city.

1. O.k. then... Apparently disagreeing with blatant money-grabs in favor of good quality content/games is toxic masculinity.   This is not the argument of anybody at all interested in gaming as a real hobby or culture.  It's a fucking sad state of affairs...  Unfortunately, given that the mobile game is still probably going to make shitloads of money, he'll probably be able to use that fact in the future that he was actually right about this nonsensical claim.     I'm more and more disgusted with the fact that most of AAA gaming is turning into Hollywood 2.0 where all that matters is squeezing increasingly mediocre amounts of money out of half-assed sequels and copycats of marginally original independent games.     As a gamer that's 45 years old and still remembers the excitement of playing Pitfall on an old Atari 2600, it's become fucking hard to even give a 'meh' about any 'big' release these days.

8. 							I dont want to make it out like that, but thankfully the Admins didnt do it (yet).  Also, we can freely converse for now, so at this moment my opinions is positive.   Either way, theres subreddits filled with actual bigots and idiots and subreddits i thought of as good, sadly have a political bias, that is unfathomable stupid. Heck, not even politics. Just overall idiocy that is mainstream there.  /r/Christianity? Full of catholics that are going to shit on you, when you talk shit about their church. Still i enjoy it.  /r/Inceltears? I enjoy it too and its purpose is one i can get behind. But its so heavily Left-leaning, the Mod admitted its an Anti-Anti-PC sub, Feminism is advocated as good there and defended and comments that talk shit about Trump or the right are upvoted.  /r/Braincels? Not as bad as people make it out to be, but it sadly has its degenerates too and likes to say some nasty shit. But im regulary upvoted when trying to converse with empathetic comments.   /r/PPD? Its good, but the lack of good content is good and bad at the same time. Its either cause reporting true PPD gets shut down with censoring (unlikely in my eyes), or that equality really, really starts to strike and theres less and less people pulling the women card. Also, it sometimes DOES upvote misogynistic comments, but its mostly good.  Theres subreddits like /r/dankchristianmemes, /r/imgoingtohellforthis and /r/pawg that are just perfect subreddits where i dont experience any general negativity, except the rare idiot  that tries to argue.  I went off topic, oops. But Tl;Dr i generally enjoy reddit, even though it has its retardation and bigot lefts here and there.

1. This is a reminder that the Firewatch developers threatened to abuse YouTube’s copyright system against PewDiePie because he accidentally said “Nigger” while streaming PUBG, a game they have no involvement in at all.  Shadow Warrior 2 is not as good as the first one was but pretty fun and Superhot is interesting.

14. 		The worst part about this story is that Pewdiepie was on "chat with friends only" when he said nigga. He say it because he got angry during lag, as it happens to all of us someday lets dont lie about it, and there was a black guy in his friends who heard that and did start to laugh.   Yet ofc people are picking up this story , ignore facts and rewrite it as a clickbait such as "Pewdiepie say N word towards other people on the internet"

2. 	It's projection once again. They feel "Entitled" to our fucking money and adoration, and get pissy when we don't give it. Try earning it you helicopter parented twatbags.  They don't *have* to give us the games we want, it's not the law. Nor do we *have* to give them any fucking money. The only thing that could be law or a have to thing would be them not overly lying about what they mean to sell us, and that's a grey area legally what with the concept of Caveat emptor and such.  Having said that I sat through a pretty funny rekita law stream where a guy sued to get his down payment back on a house because the former owner didn't warn him it was haunted.  If I understood the judgement properly, the guy won. The judge did tons of ghost related dad jokes and seemed to rule that "Yeah you should have warned him it was haunted, how was he suppose to know?"  So the house is *legally* haunted.

She pulled one or a few, and he pussed out. She emasculated him and now she’s advertising it on social media.

8. 						Abortion is not eugenics. Aborting a fetus because you didn't mean to get pregnant, changed your mind about having a child, or because having it would endanger your life is not even remotely close to eugenics. The only situation I can think of that is if you find out the baby is going to have some kind of birth defect. And even then, no one aborts it because they want to improve the human race, they'd do it because they either think they're incapable of raising a kid like that, or they don't want the kid to suffer.   >planned parenthood is still doing a great job of furthering Margaret Sanger's goals when she founded it.. the eradication of blacks.   This is just a borderline retarded statement. The black population is rising in America. [Source](  >"The black or African-American population grew by 1.2 percent to 46.8 million."  If their goal is to eradicate black people (which it's not), they're doing a real shitty job.

12. 										>You can make a strong argument that abortion as a concept was pushed as a means to achieve eugenics, given who the demographics who are the main focus of abortion propaganda.   And Planed Parenthood was formed with the intention of eliminating black people. Irrelevant because that was then and this is now. That's not what abortion is used for anymore, and the reason it began has no baring on its purpose in the present when its changed so much.   >I call BS on this reasoning, the entirety of the west was fed this line in the past and now they are ruining with "the birth rates are too low we need to import people from other countries too prop up our decaying workforce/tax paying force"   Drastically decreasing or increasing population are both not good. With increasing, it's hard to keep the resources up to provide for more and more people. However, rapidly decreasing populations have trouble finding people to maintain all the already existing infrastructure while the previous generation retires/dies out.

2. 	i dont think you have thought this through.  if the majority of leaders/heads of state in history have been men, then your adversary will be a man to, so for every victory a man leader achieves his adversary also a man gets a loss making no difference (equal win and loss)  so you can only compare men versus women heads of state conflicts. and so if women lose 30% of those conflicts by definition the men must lose 70%

11. 										Still not explaining how I'm wrong. I told you in excruciating detail how you were wrong, and you got nothin'. You haven't addressed any arguments, because you can't. You are a failure. Your parents would be disappointed in you, if they weren't also retarded. Continuing to call you a dumb cunt would be an insult to dumb cunts everywhere.

4. 			See, I don't think that's a good look though, since most people just think it's an indicator of mild retardation to use the meme. Maybe a very small percentage of twitter warriors are indeed triggered, but most people just dgaf if someone calls them an NPC. It implies that the user of the meme think they are the Dovahkiin or some shit. It's cringeworthy and borderline teleporting behind you.

8. 							Andy Dick is not responsible for the deaths of Chris Farley or Phil Hartman.  You are responsible for your own actions. If someone offers you drugs and you take them and do something regrettable, that's 100% on you. That's what being accountable for your own actions is.  Phil Hartmans wife was a cunt who murdered him. Chris Farley had a substance abuse problem and a burning desire for attention.

3. 		The only time they will talk about cameras in the back is to use it as a way to keep people in line. If they don’t say that some people will think it’s ok to do anything back there.   In some cases there are cameras but most likely there is not someone sitting there watching the feed. Those places are all about making money and they’re not gonna waste some on paying someone to watch all night  In regards to bringing this up with them keep in mind that where you live plays a roll. In some areas this may be less common but overall it’s important to know that strippers are whores who dance for money cause Whore houses are not legal   In just about every club you will see these options  1) table dance: here is where they will dance for you at your table or at the bar. Usually topless. Usually 10 bucks. This is where they will try to seduce you and upsell you on the other services, lap dance and champagne room   2) lap dance: average cost $25 per song. This is where things get a little more spicy and you can even fuck girls here. If you have a condom and she is ok with it you may be able to stick it in. Obviously you should know if she’s up for that sort of thing before you try. See if she lets you stick a finger in or if she touches your cock. Many of them while play with it here even out of your pants if they like you   3) this is the champagne room which is just for fucking no matter what you’ve been told. Some of these whores are master manipulators so if they can get you in there without having to fuck you they will. They’ll say they can blow you or that “you’ll have a good time” without being specific. You need to talk with them like they are merchants selling a good not like they are queens or princesses.   Most of these women have pimps no matter how normal they seem. They are not. These are not the girls who work at your local Starbucks or Whole Foods. These are dirty, filthy, criminal whores who are willing to do whatever they can for easy money.   If you seem like a pussy or a cop they will be skeptical. Be cool. Be confident.   There are different kinds of whores in strip clubs and some are more direct than others. Also there is a culture in these places. Two clubs on the same block may have different cultures. 1 club may be more open about what happens while the other acts is if nothing happens   Try to go to the one that is more open then try to find the girl who is the most straight forward.   Talk to her and ask if she does rooms. When she says yes ask her what she does back there. Most will tell you what they’re all about right there.   This is where you will want to negotiate   This is how it works   There will be 2 or 3 things you’ll need to account for   1) there will always be a cost for the room. This goes to the club and will provide you the room for your session. It is usually 15 minutes but can be 30   The cost will range between 50 and 100 bucks for the room and is usually non negotiable. The Whore doesn’t get any of this so she’ll want to cover that then add her cost   This is will vary based on the quality of the whore   The better looking the more they’ll ask for. Also depending on blow job or sex you’ll have a different price   If you want the get the nastiest whore in there expect the the room fee plus 50 to 100 for her  Better looking girls usually want at least 100 for themselves to fuck. Again this all varies and is negotiable.   My rule of thumb is never to go over 200 total but I’m usually drunk and go for the sluttiest over the hottest.   Make sure she tells you in plain English what you’re getting and you don’t just go off of “it will be good”  Have her agree to sex or head for the price you set and have fun.   I get the total cost from them and that’s it.   Thirdly sometimes there is like a bottle chick who brings you back there and sets up the room. They’ll try to sell you a bottle tell them no. Tip them if they are there and they’ll leave you alone while you fuck  Don’t tip them and they’ll be hollering through the curtain the second 15 minutes passes  Find a place where the whore has direct access to the room, talk about what she wants, negotiate your price. Again, sweet spot for me is 100 to 150 total.   I’ve had countless blowjobs and fuck sessions in clubs over the years and have loved every one of them.   I’ve even taken strippers home for free and fucked them but that’s another story and takes too much time sometimes   Anyway. Any other questions and I’ll do my best to answer   Edit: cameras will only be mentioned for lap dance area. Champagne room there is no issue with cameras as anything goes there.

2. 	Agreed. This is a cheap-to-execute measure to reduce fondling and groping; these are the kind of measures we should generally be glad of. To wit, we don't have such things in North America even though 'womyn's rights' are so much further along here. Why? Because we aren't jamming our fingers in strangers cunts on the bus. At least... not unless you get 'the look' ;)

2. 	Yes, that's what women are - commie relationship police, and that's why this is funny.  The front holes want to be the sole arbiters of acceptable sexuality, and being confronted by a female and being told "no, this is not appropriate in this setting" - is fucking hilarious.  Even after the organization bent over backwards to make this right, she still goes to the media, as she is a "victim".  She has no right to be upset, this is the bed she made.  Her distress is amusing.  Edit to add: The (most likely immigrant female staff member) certainly has the right to be upset about the attention-whore's self described sexual activity in a public area.  I also have the right to be upset about gay pride marches, general faggotry, rainbow crosswalks, and white genocide. :)

3. 		>The Christian wackjobs actually cared about things, often too much. That's what drove them. "Saving" people/children from sins   Exactly. At least with the Churchies, there was an "out". You could ask for forgiveness, and *you would be forgiven* even if you were a godless heathen.  SJWs never forgive outsiders. If you used the word "faggot" once during a drunk-stream 3 years ago, you are forever branded as a "sexist, racist, homophobe".  Shit, even if you never did anything racist nor sexist nor homophobic ever, you are branded a "racist, sexist, homophobe"  But if you are a male "feminist" you can pretty much abuse and/or rape any SJW chick you want. Your only worry is the actual police arresting you. SJWs care not.. they prefer to Memory Hole all male "feminist" rapists.  Whcih is my advice to all male college students. Pretend to be an SJW and you will get all the pussy you want for 4 years with zero consequences... except crabs.

4. 			Well it certainly didn't do any favors to the idea that journalists (generally speaking) are ethical, which is certainly a big part of what got Trump elected. Lots of people had known these journalists were just paid advertisements, and when they coordinated to fabricate a narrative in such a blatantly obvious way it left a sour taste in people's mouths. Then the mainstream media started trying to pull that same bullshit on Trump, and they got stomped.  On top of that, the social justice identity politics bullshit had been running wild in other media and hit a big brick wall when they got to video games. Nobody was having their bullshit, and they had no idea how to handle it except to cry and make shit up and fake death threats, so on the other side we just... let them. Because it was stupid, and it was clear to any reasonable person that it was stupid. And it worked. Gamergate found the cure to the social justice identity politics cancer.  So while I wouldn't say 5 guys is *the* reason Trump is President, I'd *definitely* say it contributed. Personally, another big factor is the fact that the social justice identity politics crowd is fucking insufferable and when they don't get their way their response is to get even *more* fucking insufferable and try to burn everything to the ground. Honestly, I think they're responsible for making more Trump supporters than any group of actual recruiters.  Thanks, retards!

Maybe it is the fact that the US does not guarantee well being to its citizens, knows a lot of awful ghettos that are being completely ignored by legislators and has a retarded system overall.  You can blame it on skin colour, tell me it will happen in Europe as well. But it won't happen here because we don't mind paying taxes for a good system because we aren't retarded.

1. Fun fact: Sunglasses became a popular fashion item because people saw behind-the-scenes photos of movie stars wearing them. But the movie stars were actually wearing them to protect their eyes from bright studio lights.

13. 												Again you are trying to prove that something was going on in the 20s with evidence way more recent. All of this because you couldn't admit to have written a stupid comment. I'm finished here as you are just a lazy cunt who can't even ON THE WHOLE INTERNET find something to back up his bullshit. I say it again and then I'll be done with it:   I never said that I don't believe product placement is real but I doubt it was used IN THE 20S FOR SUNGLASSES and if you want to make me believe that you've got to prove it otherwise you are just bitchin around. I hope you're gonna delete your comments because they show clearly what a phony bitch you are.

6. 					> And their video division is the shining jewel of being consistently profitable, now they decided to put a bullet in it.  Not sure what you're saying there.  > Telling every Japanese dev that they need to contact their American head office at American hours and talk to them in English in order to get their Japanese game approved for the Japanese market is going to hurt badly.  Of course it will hurt, but it's not going to hurt as much as losing all the PSone and PS2 profits on PS3 did. And it's not going to hurt as much as their film division does all the time and has been for years. People have said Sony will be dead soon for over a decade at this point.   Being retarded about Japanese games isn't going to just kill PS instantly. Companies as large as Sony can take a massive beating and keep trucking along.  > And Sony Pictures has been such a massive drag on their profitability that it's the main cause of them being unprofitable year, they needed to sell the rights to Spiderman back to Disney to limit the hemorrhaging and that was years ago.  lol, that's the only thing they have that makes them consistent money and they own part of the character itself. It ain't happening. If they're keeping Sony Pictures, they're keeping Spidey.

1. This procedure should be illegal. When will people realize that the foreskin is there for a reason? It has a protective function on an infant (hence why its literally stuck on the glans at that age, it works as a sterile package to PREVENT infections from feces and urine to the glans, that is why you NEVER forcibly retract and just clean/wipe like a finger) and later has a major sexual advantage for the man and his partner? Removing it is thus HARMFUL to a child. If an adult wants to skin their dick, they are free to do so. But doing it to an infant is stupid at best and evil at worst.

1. I hate anytime a woman is spared jail because of her sex, but especially cases like this. It's more or less what happened with my own mother, who had me when she was 35 and my dad was 13. She was actually sentenced to 2 years, but served 6 months until the judge released her because she was pregnant and the judge thought she should be free to raise me  Utter foolishness. The years that I was living alone with her were the worst in my life, and it was a relief when she died. The foster care system certainly isn't prefect, but how the fuck can the judge think letting the kids live alone with a convicted child rapist is any better?   If the rapist were a father, he'd be in jail and lose custody. This is mostly a matter of the judge not seeing this cunt as a genuine predator or a threat to society because she's female and the victim was a boy

4. 			Doesnt matter though. I would say the difference is almost certainly causes by a lack of intent and instead a cry for help. How could the researchers even possibly know that? Indeed the person themselves might not even realize they subconsciously took the less likely to kill you method  Its quite simple. Men kill themselves a lot more than women, so even if women Do attempt more, first the group that is actually dying should take preference, and second you have to ask if they do attempt more why are men dying at 4x the rate? The answer is because women take less certain suicide methods, but the only logical explanation for that is that it is a cry for help, even if subconsciously, because they know deep down people will help. Indeed there is no other logical explanation other than something as vain as "women dont want to mess up their bodies" which is much more ridiculous than suggesting its a cry for help.   There is only one logical explanation why women, if they do attempt more than men, only die at a quarter of the rate, and that is because they use it as a cry for help. If they actually had intent then they would choose a more certain methods. Indeed you say these researchers state it isnt due to lack of intent. First where is your evidence for this? Second, lets say that some researchers state that, what is the basis for it? Is it that they asked the woman and She said she intended to? If so thats bullshit, people will lie all the time to make themselves look less stupid, I certainly wouldnt want to be seen as looking for attention (not that that is what a cry for help is, but sadly some people see it that way) if asked so id probably lie too. Indeed even if we concede that they arent lying and believe they wanted to do it, the human psyche works on many levels and we do things we dont even think we in tend subconsciously a lot.  The reason that the while "women attempt more" claim is distracting bullshit can be split into the point below.   1. The evidence seems very shakey and is based on sources that vary wildly in their numbers. Furthermore it is ridiculous hard to define what counts as attempted suicide and what doesnt. Does someone slicing part of their forearm with a razor in a non lethal spot count? Someone taking a dose of paracetamol that is absolutely non lethal? Its so vague and undefined its practically useless. In contract someone actually killing themselves is a much more sturdy and verifiable figure  2. EVEN IF we are to assume that women attempt more, so what? Men are dying at 4x the rate, whether women attempt more is irrelevant we should absolutely prioritize the group actually fucking dying. Thats what I never got about the while "women attempt more" nonsense. Even if it is objectively true it doesnt matter as the group actually dying should be prioritize. Thats like saying "4x more men died than women in said more" and someone else saying "yeah but more women got injured". As related to above, not only is "injured" (just like "attempted") very vague, but its Also irrelevant, the group actually dying should be prioritized.  3. There is no other logical explanation that women apparently attempt at twice the rate but men die 4x more (I.e. For every 1 man who does 7 women attempt and only one dies) than woman arent using lethal methods on purpise as a cry for help. Indeed there arent any other logical conclusions, and there is far more sympathy and support for women than men regarding mental health issue, so that is the logical conclusion. Indeed you say that researchers assert that it is not due to a lack of intent to die. That poses a lot of questions. First why is this the one thing you havent provide sources for? Second what reasons do they give? Third, assuming the first and second question have a valid answer, how in the hell would they know, they arent the person themselves so it is impossible to tell what their actual intent is. Indeed people lie all the time when it comes to the intent of their actions. Not many suicide attempted who did do it as a cry for help are gna say "yeah I never actually meant to kill myself I just wanted help". Personally testimony is useless as people lie, especially in cases where it could seriously affect how people view them if they told the truth. Four, lets say that there is some evidence women dont have a less intent to die, and lets also assume none of them are lying if such evidence exists, its still useless because the person themselves mightnt know their intentions at the time. The human psycho works on many levels. Ever had a "gut feeling"? Thats often your body picling up on subtle hints that you dont consciously process. Sinilarly, even if a woman thought she wanted to die, her body might have picked up that crying for help would provide her the help she needs leading her to subconsciously picking a less lethal methods.   4. Lets say you somehow met the above 3 points. What is the reason then that it takes 8 women attempting to have the same number of deaths as 1 man attempting? No counter theory and its all use less, and even if you do have one, unless you can satisfy the above Four points, it wont be valid  That is the problem. If it takes 8x the woman attempting to have the same numbers of deaths as guys (assuming 2x higher attempt rate in women, and 4x higher actual suicide rate in men) then the only logical conclusion is theyre crying for help. If you want to provide another theory thats fine. But stating "researchers state they intent to kill themselves" with out evidence is useless, even if you have that evidence its Also useless as it is impossible for the researchers to actually understand the intent of another person, even if they do have some kind of evidence to understand their intent (E. G. Questionnaires) that is also not very helpful as it would require the replyees to not be free lying about a topic they would likely be lying about, and if we assume they arent lying then that doesnt a count for lack of intent as we cant know what subconsciously processes might have take place, as many times people do things they wouldnt consciously or didnt consciously understand because they were doing do subconsciously. Indeed I may think Im doing XX for someone to be helpful, when my subconsciously intent is something completely different based in a past experience.  And as I say, even if by some niracle we assume that this evidence you havent provide of researchers who, if it does exist, can apparently read minds, and if it is based on statistical data like questionnaires requires the woman not to be lying AND to not have any subconscious actions which make even her unsure of her own actions, even IF we assume you somehow have some magical evidence that fits all the above criteria,  AND on top of that, they have a differening theory which logically resolve the great disrepancy between actual suicide attempt to death rate, even IF you have all that (hint:you dont), it doesnt matter. Why? Men are dying at 4x the rate, thats what matters. Those are the figure that matter.  Indeed that is the most disgusting part about the "women attempt more" statistic that gets thrown around. Even IF we are to assume its true and women attempt more and have just as much intent as men, it doesnt change the fact that men are dying that 4x the rate. This is people fucking lives this is the largest killer of men under 35 in the UK and many other countries. Trying to deflect away from that and make it a womans issue by saying "well women attempt more so women are actually more oppressed by this" while men are out their dying in droves is the most sickening thing of all. Its not a competition, this is people dying. The way feminists try to use that to try and deflect and down play the fact that men are dying in the masses from suicide and instead try to make it a womans issue, ignoring the fact that in doing so theyll be driving resources away from men and leading to many more deaths, is the most horrific part of all. Even if the extremely suspicious "fact" of women attempting more AND having just as much intent is true, throwing that around to make your side seem more oppressed and doing so taking resources and attention away from men who are actually dying, is the most disgusting thing you can do, and purely evidenced why people say feminist is fuck all about equality.

4. 			Was gonna comment with that study as well. On the one hand I find it fairly perplexing that women just find almost no physical attraction to the vast majority of men. I understand that evolutionary speaking it wasn't the most important factor for reproduction unlike with men to women but how retarded is it that it's THIS low? I mean you'd think it would be beneficial for reproduction for the sexes to actually be attracted to one another. I ofc don't know how the modern environment influences all this but I don't imagine it to be much considering the cited numbers.

5. 		> In my opinion I'm a decent looking dude, but apparently not good enough  Lol I wouldn't worry about it. It's never enough for women. The OK cupid study will tell you that women rated 0% of men as most attractive. Personally, one of the ugliest hags I know in college told me that she doesn't find a single guy is attractive (in the entire college). The next year, she's in a relationship with a pussy whipped faggot. Scrawny and ugly but still above her in looks. I feel bad for the dude. I feel like telling him that she doesn't find him attractive at all and just using him for his money but I like to mind my own business.   My point is that, no guy is ever attractive enough for women. You can bring them the hottest guy on the planet and they would still keep wondering if they can do better. Fuck that shit, GYOW.

The formation of that country even blatantly stated it was formed as a homeland for that one group!  Israel has a large Arab population. "The formation of that country" was not a statement, but the Declaration of Independence stated that people of all races and religions would be treated equally.   Not sure why you have a problem with them.   > You don't see that country taking in any refugees yet their people constantly say that America needs to open its border to refugees.   "Their people" do no such thing. Netanyahu is a big supporter of Trump. It's hard-left American and European Jews who say otherwise, and they usually hate Israel as much as anyone.

8. 							You literally are ignoring facts to say it is only white people who are the bulk of people behind sjw shit when in reality they are only one of the two most prominent groups.  Also for the record, who the fuck said that I am white?  ​  I am Asian. I see some Asian people do sjw shit too if they live in California but they are not part of the two biggest groups who push sjw shit though.  Stop trying to use your strawman of evil juice to discount facts.  ​  Anyone who cares about human rights has a problem with the cruel treatment of Palestinians by their authoritarian ethnostate neighbors who always can use the anti-semitism card as their golden shield when anyone even calls them out on their hypocrisy or makes a legit criticism.  Many of their expats do advocate for opening borders in western nations yet at the same they fully support denying all refugees in their country.  Also,  American and Europeans Jews aren't a monolith of leftists who all hate Israel and want mass migration everywhere, there are many right leaning expats among their ranks who somehow think it is okay to push open borders for other western countries but not for their own country of Israel.  ​

My bad, I assumed it because the last guy who said these things was a 'pro-white' fellow who wanted to cover up how many white people are SJWs.  > ​Anyone who cares about human rights has a problem with the cruel treatment of Palestinians by their authoritarian ethnostate neighbors   I'm fairly astonished that the humane treatment by Israel is 'cruel' (while blowing up children is apparently fine), and that Israel, a country with a double-digit percentage population of Arabs is an ethnostate, and PA territories with zero Jews are not.   > who always can use the anti-semitism card as their golden shield when anyone even calls them out on their hypocrisy or makes a legit criticism.  Legit criticisms are rare.  > Many of their expats  Jews in the West are not 'expats'. They did not leave Israel.   > Also, American and Europeans Jews aren't a monolith of leftists who all hate Israel and want mass migration everywhere, there are many right leaning expats among their ranks who somehow think it is okay to push open borders for other western countries but not for their own country of Israel.  Yes, but most of the open borders idiots hate Israel as much as any regressive does. So what is your point?

11. 										> If you think Israel's world class military brutality is humane, holy shit.  Very much so. No other country would deal so mildly with a population that harbors and supports vicious terrorists who intentionally slaughter innocents.  > One can criticize inhumane acts on both sides without picking one.  Except that your 'both sides' condemnation of 'Palestine' (which does not exist) was pro forma and only given to justify your attacks on Israel. You are evidently primarily concerned with supposed Israeli brutality.  > Legitimate criticisms are rare?  You have yet to make one.  > There are a lot of problems with that country's policies and the regular Israeli citizens themselves will vocally let you know.  Yes, precisely the same sort of SJW that in the United States calls for open borders. As I told you.  > Also there are Israeli expats, you make it seem like there aren't any in the west.  Your automatic assumption that evil Juice == Israeli expats is incorrect. There are plenty of evil Juice who have nothing whatsoever to do with Israel.  > You keep thinking that all open borders people hate Israel, there are many who love Israel but hypocritically want open borders but only in other nations.  Name a few. I have noticed the opposite correlation. There are very few who want open borders who also strongly support Israel.   > You seem to have a extremely biased preferential view towards Israel  No, factual. It is an outpost of Western civilization that is surrounded by Islamic savagery.

Also how many students actually do have sensory issues? I feel like it's not enough to change anything. At what point do we say, "That's a you problem"? Because we can't change the world for a tiny minority of people. Loud noises exist.   People talking triggers me. People being in the store when I am triggers me. Please stay in your houses from 8am to 12pm so that I can shop without being triggered. Thank you. I am oppressed unless you are woke and let me not be triggered. Ugh, retarded.

So don't be a faggot and try to change what I said after the fact to make it out like i'm the one who's pretending to know a stranger on the internet. That's you lol. 'you must be a *fat incel* to have your opinions' lolol. That shit is so stale it wouldn't have bite even if it applied to me. It's like calling a marxist a cuck. They're completely desensitized to it.  No, I don't watch tennis. What I did watch was Williams chimp out for 15 solid minutes and completely embarrass herself, using her daughter as a shield and now playing the feminist card. Disgraceful. If men do that too and get no warnings (which i doubt, i think they do it and know when to quit, unlike this gorilla creature) then it's a pass on their part and a separate issue. No one can complain about rules being enforced or blame others for their own behavior.  I did hear the dialogue. I heard calm explanation from the ref and escalating emotion from Williams. I heard her tell him to stop talking to her and then I heard her resume her shit talk less than 10 seconds later. Then I saw her go over his head and then pull crocodile tears when they told her the same thing. There is no context in which her behavior is acceptable. Maybe in a ghetto.  Also, yep. You are clearly here to subvert and concern troll based off of your own description of this sub. Keep trying to moralize us Alinsky style, feminist

1. I was talking to my GF about this and we both agree remaking old movies with feminist over tones is pretty retarded.   No one has an issue with feminist movies as long as they are original and GOOD. No one wants these forced remakes just for “muh lead character has a pussy”. It’s lazy and even more insulting to their movement if you ask me.

1. Its just a grapeshot of random useless facts that aren't even always true.  Most people can't tell you anything intelligent after 12 years of indoctrination.  If they can it's because they taught themselves.    They can't teach people how to THINK because if they did, there is a risk we would think for ourselves and get rid of the retarded education system

2. 	the black male rape myth is a massive lie. we even managed to elect the biggest cuck on the planet despite his pressuring the NYPD to 'execute' a group of kids that were merely in the vicinity of a woman being raped in central park. He helped an ACTUAL rapist stay out of jail, and rape/murder numerous women. Even though the actual guy's DNA matched and he says he did it alone, Trump still thinks the kids were guilty.  Isn't that fucking insane that he still got elected? Rofl.

8. 							Yes I am thankful for not being that and just being straight les. Which I don't have a problem with. It's the teenage 15 year old attitude mixed with Tumblr angst and stupid showtunes all the time, and when she once said all people born in the 1950s need to die. I got on her big time for that. I told her she basically said she wanted her grandparents dead... Why she said it.. It was posted on her Facebook because her woke friends think people born on the 50s are against gay marriage and must die.  I had to lay out common sense to her, with a snap out of the bubble talk.  I haven't heard anything that retarded for a while thankfully.  As for my wife. She really isn't that political. It's funny she took a political test online in 2016 and it gave her a 92 rating leaning for trump... More then me. She was so distraught, she has shut up about politics since and doesn't talk or like when anyone even brings it up. Of course she couldn't vote that way. Planned parenthood used to pay for female issue stuff before when we both didn't have insurance.  I don't know how she scored that when I had to explain why illegal immigration is bad. She kept bringing up that her grandparents were immigrants from Austria and Serbia in the 40s so it wasn't bad. I had to explain the difference and how the news and her comedy shows warp things.

Fucken saving the world one broken nose at a time queens"***  ​  Her response?  ***"Yeah or choke them out because regardless the cops in a small town that still doesn’t believe in women’s rights won’t believe you anyway***"  ​  She states that it's victim blaming on her part!  But the innocent guy she choked out, oh it's just funny!

2. 	There's a lot of this sentiment going around twoX. A top rated post was about  "badass Ashley" who turned around and punched a guy who was following a woman. another was called "my girl is savage" and was about women attacking their attackers.   both posts were obviously fake. advocating dangerous violence. the idea is that women should take control of the situation. the reality is frequently different. nobody seems to care over there.

6. 					> You think it was badass?  yeah honestly. Obviously very unfortunate it was on an innocent man though.  > If it's not a big deal go ahead and let someone choke you out to unconsciousness.  He wasn't even fully unconscious. My brother's done that to me before from wrestling. It's not a big deal in itself. There's plenty of clips of people fully choking each other out on youtube.   > You ever see in the news where people hit their heads on the floor, street, ground, etc and die?   Never from being choked, no. Yeah from being punched, but if we're gonna use "the worst possible thing that could happen" as a way of judging reactions any self defense would be considered unjustifiable.  > Again he is supposed to not be a pussy about it and man up, because it was just a little ole woman.  I never said he was a pussy, or that her being a woman should make a difference. Even if it was a man, I hope I'd have the decency to put myself in the other persons shoes and not ruin their life over a genuine mistake. It's not like she she started punching his face in or anything.  > Also let me ask, Since she obviously didn't have her female friend's consent to smack her ass, shouldn't she be charged with sexual assault?  No, in that case I'd feel she's being a bitch for getting her friend charged when she didn't mean offense. I have seen a woman start beating another woman she didn't know for smacking her ass, and I feel it was justified, tbh.  > Again no one cares about what happened to him  Physically he's fine. On the tiny chance he is genuinely really psychologically damaged by this, that's why i said he should be able to sue for compensation if he really wants.

8. 							because she didn't think it was an innocent person, and the whole "men can't fight back" thing is partially bollocks in this case. He knew there was cctv and you are allowed to defend yourself. The reason he didn't as he stated, is because he didn't realize it wasn't just a joke.

10. 									I don't expect men not to defend themself if they're innocent and get assaulted. If he'd done so, the cctv would have completely exonerated him. Self defense is the law, it's unfortunate it gets subverted by feminazis and white knights sometimes.  Can you honestly say you've never acted wrongly to another person out of a mistaken perception? That's what she did. You're recontextualizing it as part of some greater injustice against men, and I don't think that's fair at all. That's what feminists do constantly and it's retarded and because people accept their recontextualization of everything instead of judging action by the actions, that's why things get fucked up so much.

12. 											When guys sexually assault women, like by grabbing the butt, they expect to get away with it, just like when cunty women hit innocent men out of entitlement and unprovoked malice.   That's the kind of cunty behavior I think warrants "excessive" response.   Women shouldn't have any special rights over men.  There is a dichotomy between men and women. I don't believe in feminist propaganda style exact sameness, so I do think it would be better not to choke a woman out just for slapping your butt, since she probably didn't mean offense. However like, if a woman deliberately slaps a married man's butt in front of his wife to be a bitch, and then the either of them chokes the bitch out, great.  Intent matters.

16. 							It is impressive. People pay good money to see that technique and enjoy MMA, let alone on someone twice your size. She also fucked up like an idiot going after an innocent guy.  And I hate when women are violent because they feel they can get away with it. I've been hit by women like that and both times I did nothing like a pussy, so I'm the first to laugh when i see a woman get knocked out for doing that. I don't see this woman like that, she is more like me if I had gone to hit the girl back, but missed and accidentally hit you instead. I hope you would forgive me, and not get me charged with assault.  Why are you trying to make her out as the figurehead of female evilness. Wouldn't you want to do that, to say, some big gay guy that smacked you on the butt? or if it was your sister, or whatever?

I haven't seen her twitter. Even if that's the case though, the incident in question was still a genuine mistake, and I don't advocate any real criminal punishment for it.

1. They're claiming women are entitled to shorter work weeks because they spend more time doing domestic chores at home.   Bull-fucking-shit!  I never had kids but both my ex wives left almost all of the housework to me. Their cars were always dirty and full of trash. They were quite content to let the house go to hell rather than pitch in and help.  Hell the last one could barely be convinced to turn on the fucking Roomba.  All you had to do was hit a damn button. Apparently that sort of thing was beneath their dignity.   Looking back the only women I've ever known who could be bothered to clean were born prior to the 1950s.

5. 				At this point I've decided that it just isn't worth the hassle. A while back I realized that most of my happiest memories are from times when I was single. I also enjoyed being alone.  So why was I looking for another relationship?      I guess the answer is, "because".  We're raised with the assumption that people are supposed to get married and have kids. Failing that, we're always supposed to have a gf or bf.    That doesn't have to be the case though.  After my last divorce, I knuckled down and paid my house off in just a few years. That's after I had to buy out her half of the equity and refinance.  I'm stuffing money into my retirement, and putting together some toys to keep me occupied in my old age.   I finally live in a clean house where I can relax in peace. Frankly I don't care what the "pussy stock market" does.  I'm done chasing it.

3. 		I guess 'cause there are some checks keeping things in place? I mean, he's trying to get a supreme court justice in there, making things go GOP retarded for who knows how long. And I don't mean to say I can't respect conservative values, even though I don't personally align with them, just that the current state of the Republican party is so fucked, even from a layman's point of view.  Trump does do a lot of embarrassing stuff on a regular basis, but besides the whole potential treason or whatever he hasn't done anything mind bogglingly bad, I guess. He's just kind of inept it seems, and he likes to bash the media and speak in very basic language to appeal to everyone without saying much of substance.

4. 	I dont know exactly how you feel, of course, but being a conservative white woman, I find myself really hating stupid liberal pussy-hat wearing bitches who pretend they are speaking and standing up for "women" while they are tearing down the very culture that has given us so many amazing opportunities and provided them in a safe, respectful environment.
