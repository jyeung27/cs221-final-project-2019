# CS 221 Final Project 2019: Comparative Analysis of Hate Speech Across Social Media Platforms

We used three main models to analyze three data sets containing hate speech - one-versus-rest multiclassclassification,  Bidirectional  Encoder  Representations  from  Transformers  (BERT),  and  unsupervised  clus-tering.   Through  feature  analysis  and  a  comparative  study  between  models,  we  aimed  to  understand  themechanics of hate speech detectors to work towards avoiding bias and accurately predicting at-risk socialmedia accounts.

## Data Files
`1vrest.ipynb` is run on three data sets: the `hatespeechall.csv`, `reddit.csv`, and the text files found at https://github.com/aitor-garcia-p/hate-speech-dataset.

## Usage
Open the python library files in any IDE (we used Juptyer Lab) and the kernels are already set up with functions to run each separate training for each data set.

Error analysis text files are saved in the folder the python notebook is located in.
